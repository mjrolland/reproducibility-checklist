	abstract = {Research on endocrine disruptors (EDs) developed from numerous disciplines. In this concert of disciplines, epidemiology is central to inform on the relevance for humans of mechanisms and dose-response functions identiﬁed in animals, to characterize the health impact (number of attributable disease cases), the cost associated with ED exposure, and the efﬁciency of the measures taken to limit exposure. Here, we present epidemiological tools to draw valid inference regarding effects of potential EDs. Epidemiology is generally observational, requiring care to control confounding bias. Many potential EDs have a short biological half-life; approaches relying on repeated biospecimens sampling allow limiting exposure misclassiﬁcation and the resulting bias. For non-persistent compounds, couple–child cohorts are a central study design. Cohorts can now rely on molecular biology approaches to characterize exposures and intermediate pathways, which corresponds to the advent of molecular epidemiology and allows stronger interactions between epidemiology, toxicology, and molecular epidemiology to characterize the health effects of EDs.},

	abstract = {Background: Maternal urinary biomarkers are often used to assess fetal exposure to phenols and their precursors. Their effectiveness as a measure of exposure in epidemiological studies depends on their variability during pregnancy and their ability to accurately predict fetal exposure.
Objectives: We assessed the relationship between urinary and amniotic fluid concentrations of nine environmental phenols, and the reproducibility of urinary concentrations, among pregnant women.
Methods: Seventy-one women referred for amniocentesis were included. Maternal urine was collected at the time of the amniocentesis appointment and on two subsequent occasions. Urine and amniotic fluid were analyzed for 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenols, bisphenol A, benzophenone-3, triclosan, and methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparabens using online solid phase extraction–high performance liquid chromatography–isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry.
Results: Only benzophenone-3 and propylparaben were detectable in more than half of the amniotic fluid samples; for these phenols, concentrations in amniotic fluid and maternal urine collected on the same day were positively correlated (ρ = 0.53 and 0.32, respectively). Other phenols were detected infrequently in amniotic fluid (e.g., bisphenol A was detected in only two samples). The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of urinary concentrations in samples from individual women ranged from 0.48 to 0.62 for all phenols except bisphenol A (ICC = 0.11).
Conclusion: Amniotic fluid detection frequencies for most phenols were low. The reproducibility of urine measures was poor for bisphenol A, but good for the other phenols. Although a single sample may provide a reasonable estimate of exposure for some phenols, collecting multiple urine samples during pregnancy is an option to reduce exposure measurement error in studies regarding the effects of phenol prenatal exposure on health.},

	abstract = {Background: Phenols interact with nuclear receptors implicated in growth and adipogenesis regulation. Only a few studies have explored their effects on growth in humans.
Objectives: We studied the associations of maternal exposure to phenols during pregnancy with prenatal and postnatal growth of male newborns.
Methods: Within a cohort of women recruited during pregnancy, we selected 520 mother–son pairs and quantified 9 phenols in spot urine samples collected during pregnancy. We used ultrasonography during pregnancy, together with birth measurements, to assess fetal growth. We modeled individual postnatal growth trajectories from repeated measures of weight and height in the first 3 years of life.
Results: Triclosan concentration was negatively associated with growth parameters measured at the third ultrasound examination but not earlier in pregnancy. At birth, this phenol tended to be negatively associated with head circumference (−1.2 mm for an interquartile range [IQR] increase in ln-transformed triclosan concentration [95\% confidence interval = −2.6 to 0.3]) but not with weight or height. Parabens were positively associated with weight at birth. This positive association remained for 3 years for methylparaben (β = 193 g [−4 to 389]) for an IQR increase in ln-transformed concentrations.
Conclusion: We relied on only 1 spot urine sample to assess exposure; because of the high variability in phenol urinary concentrations reported during pregnancy, using only 1 sample may result in exposure misclassification, in particular for bisphenol A. Our study},

	abstract = {Background: For chemicals with high within-subject temporal variability, assessing exposure biomarkers in a spot biospecimen poorly estimates average levels over long periods. The objective is to characterize the ability of within-subject pooling of biospecimens to reduce bias due to exposure misclassification when within-subject variability in biomarker concentrations is high.
Methods: We considered chemicals with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.6 and 0.2. In a simulation study, we hypothesized that the chemical urinary concentrations averaged over a given time period were associated with a health outcome and estimated the bias of studies assessing exposure that collected 1 to 50 random biospecimens per subject. We assumed a classical type error. We studied associations using a within-subject pooling approach and two measurement error models (simulation extrapolation and regression calibration), the latter requiring the assay of more than one biospecimen per subject.
Results: For both continuous and binary outcomes, using one sample led to attenuation bias of 40\% and 80\% for compounds with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.6 and 0.2, respectively. For a compound with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.6, the numbers of biospecimens required to limit bias to less than 10\% were 6, 2, and 2 biospecimens with the pooling, simulation extrapolation, and regression calibration methods (these values were, respectively, 35, 8, and 2 for a compound with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.2). Compared with pooling, these methods did not improve power.
Conclusion: Within-subject pooling limits attenuation bias without increasing assay costs. Simulation extrapolation and regression},

	abstract = {Background: Laboratory and human studies raise concerns about endocrine disruption and asthma resulting from exposure to chemicals in consumer products. Limited labeling or testing information is available to evaluate products as exposure sources.
Objectives: We analytically quantified endocrine disruptors and asthma-related chemicals in a range of cosmetics, personal care products, cleaners, sunscreens, and vinyl products. We also evaluated whether product labels provide information that can be used to select products without these chemicals.
Methods: We selected 213 commercial products representing 50 product types. We tested 42 composited samples of high-market-share products, and we tested 43 alternative products identified using criteria expected to minimize target compounds. Analytes included parabens, phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan, ethanolamines, alkylphenols, fragrances, glycol ethers, cyclo­siloxanes, and ultrav­ iolet (UV) filters.
Results: We detected 55 compounds, indicating a wide range of exposures from common products. Vinyl products contained {\textgreater} 10\% bis(2-ethylh­ exyl) phthalate (DEHP) and could be an important source of DEHP in homes. In other products, the highest concentrations and numbers of detects were in the fragranced products (e.g., perfume, air fresheners, and dryer sheets) and in sunscreens. Some products that did not contain the well-known endocrine-disrupting phthalates contained other less-studied phthalates (dicyclohexyl phthalate, diisononyl phthalate, and di‑n‑propyl phthalate; also endocrine-disrupting compounds), suggesting a substitution. Many detected chemicals were not listed on product labels.
Conclusions: Common products contain complex mixtures of EDCs and asthma-related compounds. Toxicological studies of these mixtures are needed to understand their biological activity. Regarding epidemiology, our findings raise concern about potential confounding from co‑occurring chemicals and misc­ lassification due to variability in product composition. Consumers should be able to avoid some target chemicals—synthetic fragrances, BPA, and regulated active ingredients—using purchasing criteria. More complete product labeling would enable consumers to avoid the rest of the target chemicals.},

	abstract = {Background: Prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure may be associated with developmental toxicity, but few studies have examined the variability and predictors of urinary BPA concentrations during pregnancy.
Objective: Our goal was to estimate the variability and predictors of serial urinary BPA concentrations taken during pregnancy.
Methods: We measured BPA concentrations during pregnancy and at birth in three spot urine samples from 389 women. We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to assess BPA variability and estimated associations between log10-transformed urinary BPA concentrations and demographic, occupational, dietary, and environmental factors, using mixed models.
Results: Geometric mean (GM) creatinine-standardized concentrations (micrograms per gram) were 1.7 (16 weeks), 2.0 (26 weeks), and 2.0 (birth). Creatinine-standardized BPA concentrations exhibited low reproducibility (ICC = 0.11). By occupation, cashiers had the highest BPA concentrations (GM: 2.8 μg/g). Consuming canned vegetables at least once a day was associated with higher BPA concentrations (GM = 2.3 μg/g) compared with those consuming no canned vegetables (GM = 1.6 μg/g). BPA concentrations did not vary by consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, canned fruit, or store-bought fresh and frozen fish. Urinary high-molecular-weight phthalate and serum tobacco smoke metabolite concentrations were positively associated with BPA concentrations.
Conclusions: These results suggest numerous sources of BPA exposure during pregnancy. Etiological studies may need to measure urinary BPA concentrations more than once during pregnancy and adjust for phthalates and tobacco smoke exposures.},

	abstract = {Cytokines and chemokines are potent modulators of brain development and as such, dysregulation of the maternal immune system can result in deviations in the fetal cytokine balance, altering the course of typical brain development, and putting the individual on a “pathway to pathology”. In the current study, we used a multivariate approach to evaluate networks of interacting cytokines and investigated whether alterations in the maternal immune milieu could be linked to alcohol-related and alcohol-independent child neurodevelopmental delay. This was achieved through the measurement of 40 cytokines/chemokines from maternal blood samples collected during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Importantly, during the second trimester we identiﬁed network enrichment in levels of cytokines including IFN-ɣ, IL-10, TNF-β, TNF-α, and CRP associated with oﬀspring neurodevelopmental delay. However, as elevations in levels of these cytokines have previously been reported in a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, we suggest that this cytokine proﬁle is likely not disorder speciﬁc, but rather may be an indicator of neurodevelopmental delay in general. By contrast, distinct clusters of activated/inhibited cytokines were identiﬁed based on maternal alcohol consumption and child neurodevelopmental outcome. Speciﬁcally, cytokines including IL-15, IL-10, MDC, and members of the VEGF sub-family were highest in alcohol-consuming mothers of children with neurodevelopmental delay and were identiﬁed in both network analyses and examination of individual cytokines, whereas a diﬀerential and unique cytokine proﬁle was identiﬁed in the case of alcohol-independent child neurodevelopmental delay. We propose that the current ﬁndings could provide a critical step towards the development of early biomarkers and possibly interventions for alcohol-related neurodevelopmental delay. Importantly, the current approach could be informative for understanding mechanisms linking maternal immune system dysfunction and adverse child outcomes in a range of other neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {Background: In the current context of increasing unsafe sex, HIV incidence may have evolved, depending on HIV prevalence in sexual networks and, among HIV-infected persons who practice unsafe sex, on their infectivity and partners’ HIV serostatus. We examined calendar trends in sexual behaviours at risk of HIV-1 transmission (SBR) among 967 adults followed since primary HIV infection (ANRS PRIMO cohort) and relationship with current treatments and viral load.
Methods: Patients completed since 2000 self-administered questionnaires on sexual practices every 6 months. SBR with HIV-negative/unknown partners were analyzed among 155 heterosexual women, 142 heterosexual men and 670 MSM by using logistic generalized estimating equation models (6656 visits).
Results: During 2000–2009, the frequency of SBR did not increase signiﬁcantly among women with steady partners; risk factors were a low education level and alcohol/ smoking use. Among heterosexual men with steady partners, the frequency of SBR doubled since 2006; during this period, the only associated factor was combined antiretroviral treatment for at least 6 months or viral load less than 400 copies/ml. Among MSM, SBR increased gradually over time; SBR with steady partners was associated with a low education level and alcohol use. SBR was more frequent among MSM with casual partners; no association with viral load was found.
Conclusion: In France, recent trends and risk factors in unprotected sex with HIVnegative/unknown partners differ according to sex/sexual preference. The recent increase in SBR among heterosexual men with low viral load may be related to increasing awareness of the ‘treatment-as-prevention’ concept. The lack of association between SBR and viral load among MSM supports use of treatment-as-prevention as part of diversiﬁed prevention strategies. ß 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health {\textbar} Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins},

	abstract = {K-complexes (KCs) are thought to play a key role in sleep homeostasis and memory consolidation; however, their generation and propagation remain unclear. The commonly held view from scalp EEG findings is that KCs are primarily generated in medial frontal cortex and propagate parietally, whereas an electrocorticography (ECOG) study suggested dorsolateral prefrontal generators and an absence of KCs in many areas. In order to resolve these differing views, we used unambiguously focal bipolar depth electrode recordings in patients with intractable epilepsy to investigate spatiotemporal relationships of human KCs. KCs were marked manually on each channel, and local generation was confirmed with decreased gamma power. In most cases (76\%), KCs occurred in a single location, and rarely (1\%) in all locations. However, if automatically detected KC-like phenomena were included, only 15\% occurred in a single location, and 27\% occurred in all recorded locations. Locally generated KCs were found in all sampled areas, including cingulate, ventral temporal, and occipital cortices. Surprisingly, KCs were smallest and occurred least frequently in anterior prefrontal channels. When KCs occur on two channels, their peak order is consistent in only 13\% of cases, usually from prefrontal to lateral temporal. Overall, the anterior–posterior separation of electrode pairs explained only 2\% of the variance in their latencies. KCs in stages 2 and 3 had similar characteristics. These results open a novel view where KCs overall are universal cortical phenomena, but each KC may variably involve small or large cortical regions and spread in variable directions, allowing flexible and heterogeneous contributions to sleep homeostasis and memory consolidation.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To characterize prednisone use in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis using individual‐level heat‐maps and clustering individual trajectories of prednisone dose, and to evaluate the association between prednisone dose trajectory groups and gestational length.
Methods: This study included pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis who enrolled in the MotherToBaby Autoimmune Diseases in Pregnancy Study (2003–2014) before gestational week 20 and reported prednisone use without another oral glucocorticoid during pregnancy (n = 254). Information on medication use and pregnancy outcomes was collected by telephone interview plus by medical record review. Prednisone daily dose and cumulative dose were plotted by gestational day using a heat map for each individual. K‐means clustering was used to cluster individual trajectories of prednisone dose into groups. The associations between trajectory group and demographics, disease severity measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire at enrollment, and gestational length were evaluated.
Results: Women used prednisone 3 to 292 days during pregnancy, with daily doses ranging from {\textless}1 to 60 mg. Total cumulative dose ranged from 8 to 6225 mg. Disease severity, non‐biologic disease modifying anti‐rheumatic drug use, and gestational length varied significantly by trajectory group. After adjusting for disease severity, non‐biologic disease modifying anti‐rheumatic drug use, and other covariates, the highest vs lowest daily dose trajectory group was associated with reduced gestational age at delivery (β: −2.3 weeks (95\%: −3.4, −1.3)), as was the highest vs lowest cumulative dose trajectory group (β: −2.6 weeks (95\%: −3.6, −1.5)).
Conclusions: In pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis, patterns of higher prednisone dose were associated with shorter gestational length compared with lower dose.},

	abstract = {A retrospective study carried out recently in a large sample of men, close to the general population, has reported a signiﬁcant and strong decline in sperm concentration and morphology in the whole of France between 1989 and 2005. We studied these trends within each region of France. Data were obtained from the Fivnat database. The study sample comprised male partners of sterile women in whom both tubes were absent or blocked. They were located at the assisted reproductive technology center. A Bayesian spatio-temporal model with parametric time trends, adjusted for age, was used to model overall time trends for each region. The results show that sperm concentration decreased in almost all regions of France. Among them, Aquitaine showed the highest decrease and Midi-Pyre´ne´es had the lowest average for the whole period. Regarding total motility, most regions showed a slight increase while Bourgogne showed a steep and signiﬁcant decrease. While considering sperm morphology, there was a decrease in most of the regions. The decrease in Aquitaine and Midi-Pyre´ne´es was stronger when compared with the overall trend. In conclusion, a decrease in sperm concentration and morphology, already shown at the French metropolitan territory level, was observed in most regions of France. This is consistent with a global change in environmental exposure, according to the endocrine disruptor hypothesis especially. Indeed, ubiquitary exposure to chemicals has been growing in the general population of France since the 1950s, and the results do not appear to support the lifestyle hypothesis. The highest decreases and lowest values are consistently observed in two proximate regions that are both highly agricultural and densely populated.},

	abstract = {Background.  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected pregnant women increasingly receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). Studies suggest HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children face higher mortality than HIV-unexposed children, but most evidence relates to the pre-ART era, breastfeeding of limited duration, and considerable maternal mortality. Maternal ART and prolonged breastfeeding while on ART may improve survival, although this has not been reliably quantified.
Methods.  Individual data on 19 219 HEU children from 21 PMTCT trials/cohorts undertaken from 1995 to 2015 in Africa and Asia were pooled to estimate the association between 24-month mortality and maternal/infant factors, using random-effects Cox proportional hazards models. Adjusted attributable fractions of risks computed using the predict function in the R package “frailtypack” were used to estimate the relative contribution of risk factors to overall mortality.
Results.  Cumulative incidence of death was 5.5\% (95\% confidence interval, 5.1–5.9) by age 24 months. Low birth weight (LBW {\textless}2500 g, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR, 2.9), no breastfeeding (aHR, 2.5), and maternal death (aHR, 11.1) were significantly associated with increased mortality. Maternal ART (aHR, 0.5) was significantly associated with lower mortality. At the population level, LBW accounted for 16.2\% of 24-month mortality, never breastfeeding for 10.8\%, mother not receiving ART for 45.6\%, and maternal death for 4.3\%; combined, these factors explained 63.6\% of deaths by age 24 months.
Conclusions.  Survival of HEU children could be substantially improved if public health practices provided all HIV-infected mothers with ART and supported optimal infant feeding and care for LBW neonates.},

We performed longitudinal trajectory modeling to describe patterns of antidepressant use in the first 32 weeks of pregnancy, and test whether these trajectories are associated with a reduction in birth weight or gestational age at delivery. Our study included 166 pregnant women with deliveries between 2011 and 2015 who were prescribed an antidepressant between 91 days prior to last menstrual period and 32 weeks of gestation. From electronic medical records, we estimated average daily dose and cumulative dose per week for the first 32 weeks of gestation and for the first 13 weeks postnatal. We clustered women with similar utilization patterns using k-means longitudinal modeling and assessed the associations between trajectory group and birth weight and gestational age at delivery. We identified four cumulative dose trajectory groups and three average daily dose trajectory groups in each period. Relative to the lowest trajectory group, the highest trajectory group during pregnancy was associated with reduced birth weight in multivariable analysis (average daily highest trajectory vs. lowest trajectory β − 314.1 g, 95\% CI − 613.7, − 15.5) adjusted for depression severity score, maternal age, race, and pregnancy smoking. Trajectory groups were not associated with gestational age at delivery. The highest trajectory group of antidepressant use in pregnancy was associated with a modest reduction in birth weight but not with gestational age at delivery. Longitudinal trajectories allow for a dynamic visualization and quantification of medication use among pregnant women.},

	abstract = {Exposure of humans to bisphenol A (BPA), a widely used industrial chemical, is well-known. In humans and animals, conjugation of BPA molecule with glucuronide or sulfate is considered as a mechanism for detoxiﬁcation. Nevertheless, very few studies have directly measured free, conjugated (e.g., glucuronidated), and substituted (e.g., chlorinated) forms of BPA in human specimens. In this study, free, conjugated (BPA glucuronide or BPAG and BPA disulfate or BPADS), and substituted (chlorinated BPA; mono- [BPAMC], di-[BPADC], and trichloride [BPATrC]) forms of BPA were determined in human urine and serum samples, using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography− tandem mass spectrometry (LC−MS/MS) techniques. The instrumental calibration for each of the target compounds ranged from 0.01 to 100 ng/ mL and showed excellent linearity (r {\textgreater} 0.99). The limits of quantiﬁcation (LOQs) were 0.01 ng/mL for free BPA and 0.05 ng/mL for the conjugated and substituted BPA. Respective recoveries of the six target compounds spiked into water blanks and sample matrices (urine and serum), and passed through the entire analytical procedure, were 96 ± 14\% and 105 ± 18\% (mean ± SD) for urine samples and 87 ± 8\% and 80 ± 13\% for serum samples. The optimal recoveries of BPAG and BPADS in the analytical procedure indicted that no deconjugation occurred during the SPE procedure. The method was applied to measure six target chemicals in urine and serum samples collected from volunteers in Albany, New York. BPA and its derivatives were found in urine samples at concentrations ranging from {\textless} LOQ to a few tens of ng/mL. In serum, free and conjugated BPA were detected at sub ng/mL concentrations, whereas BPA chlorides were not detected. The urine and serum samples were also analyzed by enzymatic deconjugation and liquid−liquid extraction (LLE) for the determination of total BPA, and the results were compared with those measured by the SPE method. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report on the occurrence of BPAG and BPADS in human serum.},

Objectives: We sought to measure phenol and paraben biomarker concentrations for the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa) study, assess within-person variability, and investigate any possible external phenol or paraben contamination of specimens.
Methods: We collected three spot urines at approximately 17, 23, and 29 weeks’ gestation in a hospital setting and added a preservative containing ethyl paraben. We measured urinary concentrations and within-person variability for phenols and parabens in a MoBa sample (n=45), including a subgroup of 15 participants previously randomly selected for a bisphenol-A (BPA) exposure study who had unusually high total BPA concentrations. Additionally, we compared reliability results for total, conjugated, and free concentrations of phenolic compounds.
Results: We detected total and free BPA, butyl paraben, propyl paraben, and methyl paraben in 100\% of samples, total benzophenone-3 in 95\% of samples, and infrequently detected free benzophenone-3 and total and free 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,5-dichlorophenol. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for total, conjugated, and free concentrations ranged from relatively low for BPA to moderate for propyl paraben. ICCs were generally similar overall and by subgroup.
Conclusions: Using conjugated concentrations improved reliability estimates only for BPA. Measuring total and free concentrations, an approach which may be useful for future studies, allowed us to identify likely BPA and butyl paraben contamination of archived MoBa urine specimens.},

Objectives: The Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study addressed these data gaps by utilizing stored maternal urine samples from a large multi­center cohort study of Canadian pregnant women.
Methods: Concentrations of free and conjugated forms of BPA and TCS were measured in about 1,890 first-trimester urine samples by ultra performance liquid chromatograpy–tandem mass spectrometry using isotope dilution.
Results: The glucuronides of BPA and TCS were the predominant forms of these chemicals measured (detected in 95\% and 99\% of samples, respectively), whereas the free forms were detected in 43\% and 80\% of samples, respectively. The geometric mean urinary concentrations for glucuronides of BPA and TCS were 0.80 μg/L (95\% CI: 0.75, 0.85) and 12.30 μg/L (95\% CI: 11.08, 13.65), respectively. Significant predictors of BPA included maternal age {\textless} 25 vs. ≥ 35 years, current smoking, low vs. high household income, and low vs. high education. For TCS, urinary concentrations were significantly higher in women ≥ 25 years of age, never vs. current smokers, and women with high household income and high education.
Conclusions: The results from this study represent the largest national-level data on urinary concentrations of free and conjugated forms of BPA and TCS in pregnant women and suggest that maternal characteristics predicting elevated urinary concentrations of these phenols largely act in opposite directions.},

	abstract = {Objective: We previously demonstrated that exposure to polyvinyl chloride plastic medical devices containing di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was associated with higher urinary concentrations of several DEHP metabolites in 54 premature infants in two neonatal intensive care units than in the general population. For 42 of these infants, we evaluated urinary concentrations of several phenols, including bisphenol A (BPA), in association with the use of the same medical devices.
Measurements: We measured the urinary concentrations of free and total (free plus conjugated) species of BPA, triclosan, benzophenone-3, methyl paraben, and propyl paraben.
Results: The percentage of BPA present as its conjugated species was {\textgreater} 90\% in more than threequarters of the premature infants. Intensity of use of products containing DEHP was strongly associated with BPA total concentrations but not with any other phenol. Adjusting for institution and sex, BPA total concentrations among infants in the group of high use of DEHP-containing products were 8.75 times as high as among infants in the low use group (p {\textless} 0.0001). Similarly, after adjusting for sex and DEHP-containing product use category, BPA total concentrations among infants in Institution A were 16.6 times as high as those among infants in Institution B (p {\textless} 0.0001).
Conclusion: BPA geometric mean urinary concentration (30.3 µg/L) among premature infants undergoing intensive therapeutic medical interventions was one order of magnitude higher than that among the general population. Conjugated species were the primary urinary metabolites of BPA, suggesting that premature infants have some capacity to metabolize BPA. The differences in exposure to BPA by intensity of use of DEHP-containing medical products highlight the need for further studies to determine the specific source(s) of exposure to BPA.},

Imputing explicit values for values {\textless} LOD in a multivariate setting, such as with longitudinal data, is difficult using a likelihood-based approach. A Bayesian multiple imputation (MI) method is introduced to handle left-censored multivariate data. A Gibbs sampler, which uses an iterative process, is employed to simulate the target multivariate distribution within a Bayesian framework. Following convergence, multiple plausible data sets are generated for analysis by standard statistical methods outside of a Bayesian framework. With explicit imputed values available variables can be analyzed as outcomes or predictors. We illustrate a practical application using longitudinal data from the Community Participatory Approach to Measuring Farmworker Pesticide Exposure (PACE3) study to evaluate the association between urinary acephate concentrations (indicating pesticide exposure) and self-reported potential pesticide poisoning symptoms. Additionally, a simulation study is used to evaluate the sampling property of the estimators for distributional parameters as well as regression coefficients estimated with the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach. Results demonstrated that the Bayesian MI estimates performed well in most settings, and we recommend the use of this valid and feasible approach to analyze multivariate data with values {\textless} LOD.},

	abstract = {Background: Environmental and biomedical researchers frequently encounter laboratory data constrained by a lower limit of detection (LOD). Commonly used methods to address these leftcensored data, such as simple substitution of a constant for all values {\textless} LOD, may bias parameter estimation. In contrast, multiple imputation (MI) methods yield valid and robust parameter estimates and explicit imputed values for variables that can be analyzed as outcomes or predictors.
Objective: In this article we expand distribution-based MI methods for left-censored data to a bivariate setting, specifically, a longitudinal study with biological measures at two points in time.
Methods: We have presented the likelihood function for a bivariate normal distribution taking into account values {\textless} LOD as well as missing data assumed missing at random, and we use the estimated distributional parameters to impute values {\textless} LOD and to generate multiple plausible data sets for analysis by standard statistical methods. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the sampling properties of the estimators, and we illustrate a practical application using data from the Community Participatory Approach to Measuring Farmworker Pesticide Exposure (PACE3) study to estimate associations between urinary acephate (APE) concentrations (indicating pesticide exposure) at two points in time and self-reported symptoms.
Results: Simulation study results demonstrated that imputed and observed values together were consistent with the assumed and estimated underlying distribution. Our analysis of PACE3 data using MI to impute APE values {\textless} LOD showed that urinary APE concentration was significantly associated with potential pesticide poisoning symptoms. Results based on simple substitution methods were substantially different from those based on the MI method.
Conclusions: The distribution-based MI method is a valid and feasible approach to analyze bivariate data with values {\textless} LOD, especially when explicit values for the nondetections are needed. We recommend the use of this approach in environmental and biomedical research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate the impact of gestational and childhood bisphenol A (BPA) exposures on behavior and executive function at 3 years of age and to determine whether child gender modiﬁed those associations.
METHODS: We used a prospective birth cohort of 244 mothers and their 3-year-old children from the greater Cincinnati, Ohio, area. We characterized gestational and childhood BPA exposures by using the mean BPA concentrations in maternal (16 and 26 weeks of gestation and birth) and child (1, 2, and 3 years of age) urine samples, respectively. Behavior and executive function were measured by using the Behavior Assessment System for Children 2 (BASC-2) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool (BRIEF-P).
RESULTS: BPA was detected in Ͼ97\% of the gestational (median: 2.0 ␮g/L) and childhood (median: 4.1 ␮g/L) urine samples. With adjustment for confounders, each 10-fold increase in gestational BPA concentrations was associated with more anxious and depressed behavior on the BASC-2 and poorer emotional control and inhibition on the BRIEF-P. The magnitude of the gestational BPA associations differed according to child gender; BASC-2 and BRIEF-P scores increased 9 to 12 points among girls, but changes were null or negative among boys. Associations between childhood BPA exposure and neurobehavior were largely null and not modiﬁed by child gender.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, gestational BPA exposure affected behavioral and emotional regulation domains at 3 years of age, especially among girls.

In this work we characterize the Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI) variable importances as measured by an ensemble of totally randomized trees in asymptotic sample and ensemble size conditions. We derive a three-level decomposition of the information jointly provided by all input variables about the output in terms of i) the MDI importance of each input variable, ii) the degree of interaction of a given input variable with the other input variables, iii) the different interaction terms of a given degree. We then show that this MDI importance of a variable is equal to zero if and only if the variable is irrelevant and that the MDI importance of a relevant variable is invariant with respect to the removal or the addition of irrelevant variables. We illustrate these properties on a simple example and discuss how they may change in the case of non-totally randomized trees such as Random Forests and Extra-Trees.},

To estimate the mean vector and the covariance matrix we develop an E-M algorithm solution. Given a transformation, we obtain expressions for the mean vector, covariance matrix, and the asymptotic covariance of the vector of means in the original scale. Expressions are obtained for a conﬁdence region for the vector of means. The performance of the MLE method in selecting the correct power transformation and the coverage rate of the conﬁdence region under several conditions are investigated in a simulation study.

	abstract = {Background: Understanding important sources and pathways of exposure to common chemicals known or suspected to impact human health is critical to eliminate or reduce the exposure. This is particularly important in areas such as Puerto Rico, where residents have higher exposures to numerous chemicals, as well as higher rates of many adverse health outcomes, compared to the mainland US.
Objective: The aim of this study was to assess distributions, time trends, and predictors of urinary triclocarban, phenol, and paraben biomarkers measured at multiple times during pregnancy among women living in Northern Puerto Rico.
Methods: We recruited 1003 pregnant women between years 2010 and 2016 from prenatal clinics and collected urine samples and questionnaire data on personal care product use at up to three separate visits, between 16 and 28 weeks gestation. Urine samples were analyzed for triclocarban, seven phenols and four parabens: 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,5-dichlorophenol, benzophenone-3, bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F, triclosan, butylparaben, ethylparaben, methylparaben, and propylparaben.
Results: Detectable triclocarban, phenol and paraben concentrations among pregnant women were prevalent and tended to be higher than levels measured in women of reproductive age from the general US population, especially triclocarban, which had a median concentration 37 times higher in Puerto Rico participants (2.6 vs 0.07 ng/mL). A decreasing temporal trend was statistically significant for urine concentrations of BPA during the study period, while the BPA substitute BPS showed an increasing temporal trend. Significant and positive associations were found between biomarker concentrations with the products use in the past 48-h (soap, sunscreen, lotion, cosmetics). There was an increasing trend of triclocarban/triclosan urinary concentrations with increased concentrations of triclocarban/triclosan listed as the active ingredient in the bar soap/liquid soap products reported being used.
Conclusion: Our results suggest several potential exposure sources to triclocarban, phenols, and parabens in this population and may help inform targeted approaches to reduce exposure.},

	abstract = {Phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are ubiquitous contaminants identiﬁed as endocrine disruptors. Phthalates are worldwide used as plasticizers, in particular to improve the mechanical properties of polymers such as polyvinyl chloride. Because they are not chemically bound to the polymer, they tend to leach out with time and use. Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) are the two most common phthalates. BPA is an estrogenic compound used to manufacture polycarbonate containers for food and drink, including baby bottles. It can migrate from container into foods, especially at elevated temperatures. Diet is a predominant source of exposure for phthalates and BPA, especially for infants. The aim of this study was to test the presence of DEHP, DnBP, and BPA in infant formulas. DEHP, DnBP, and BPA concentrations were measured in 22 liquid and 28 powder milks by gas chromatography with ﬂame ionization detection and high performance liquid chromatography with ﬂuorimetric detection, respectively. DEHP concentrations in our samples were between 0.005 and 5.088 μg/g (median 0.906 μg/g), DnBP concentrations were between 0.008 and 1.297 μg/g (median 0.053 μg/g), and BPA concentrations were between 0.003 and 0.375 μg/g (median 0.015 μg/g). Concentrations of the investigated contaminants in liquid and powder milks were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, even though samples were packed in diﬀerent types of containers. These data point out potential hazards for infants fed with baby formulas. Contamination seems more related to the production of formulas than to a release from containers.},

	abstract = {Background: Air pollution exposure represents a major health threat to the developing foetus. DNA methylation is one of the most well-known molecular determinants of the epigenetic status of cells. Blood DNA methylation has been proven sensitive to air pollutants, but the molecular impact of air pollution on new-borns has so far received little attention.
Objectives: We investigated whether nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10), temperature and humidity during pregnancy are associated with diﬀerences in placental DNA methylation levels.
Methods: Whole-genome DNA-methylation was measured using the Illumina's Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in the placenta of 668 newborns from the EDEN cohort. We designed an original strategy using a priori biological information to focus on candidate genes with a speciﬁc expression pattern in placenta (active or silent) combined with an agnostic epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). We used robust linear regression to identify CpGs and diﬀerentially methylated regions (DMR) associated with each exposure during short- and longterm time-windows.
Results: The candidate genes approach identiﬁed nine CpGs mapping to 9 genes associated with prenatal NO2 and PM10 exposure [false discovery rate (FDR) p {\textless} 0.05]. Among these, the methylation level of 2 CpGs located in ADORA2B remained signiﬁcantly associated with NO2 exposure during the 2nd trimester and whole pregnancy in the EWAS (FDR p {\textless} 0.05). EWAS further revealed associations between the environmental exposures under study and variations of DNA methylation of 4 other CpGs. We further identiﬁed 27 DMRs signiﬁcantly (FDR p {\textless} 0.05) associated with air pollutants exposure and 13 DMRs with meteorological conditions.
Conclusions: The methylation of ADORA2B, a gene whose expression was previously associated with hypoxia and pre-eclampsia, was consistently found here sensitive to atmospheric pollutants. In addition, air pollutants were associated to DMRs pointing towards genes previously implicated in preeclampsia, hypertensive and metabolic disorders. These ﬁndings demonstrate that air pollutants exposure at levels commonly experienced in the European population are associated with placental gene methylation and provide some mechanistic insight into some of the reported eﬀects of air pollutants on preeclampsia.},

Public swimming pools are places that have attracted increasing concerns. In this article, 35 outdoor swimming pools in Changsha City (China) were examined in view of the occurrence of 22 target PCPs contaminants, which fall into four categories: preservatives, UV ﬁlters, anticorrosion agents, and antimicrobials. Out of them, 16 compounds were detected in the collected samples. The preservatives was the most dominant category, with methyl paraben being the top compound (a.v. 0.85 μg/L) followed by p-hydroxybenzoic acid (a.v. 0.13 μg/L) and 1H-benzotriazole (a.v. 0.14 μg/L). The correlations among 22 PCPs and their four categories were evaluated using the nonparametric Spearman correlations analysis. In the source tracing investigation, the level of PCPs in swimming pools was determined to be primarily associated with the consumption of these products while weakly related to the ﬁlling waters. The quantitative risk assessment revealed that the PCPs concentrations were at a safe level.},

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study associations between prenatal exposure to phthalates and several phenols on behavior among male infants.
METHODS: We quantiﬁed 11 phthalate metabolites and nine phenols (four parabens, benzophenone-3, BPA, two dichlorophenols, triclosan) in spot urine samples collected during pregnancy among EDEN cohort mothers who delivered a boy. Mothers completed the Strength and Diﬃculties Questionnaire (SDQ) when their children were 3.1 (n = 529) and 5.6 (n = 464) y old.
RESULTS: BPA was positively associated with the relationship problems subscale at 3 y [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.11; 95\% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.20] and the hyperactivity–inattention subscale scores at 5 y (IRR: 1.08; 95\% CI: 1.01, 1.14). Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) was positively associated with internalizing behavior, relationship problem, and emotional symptom scores at 3 y. Monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) was positively associated with internalizing behavior and relationship problems scores at 3 y. After dichotomizing SDQ scores, triclosan tended to be positively associated with emotional symptom subscales at both 3 and 5 y.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations between BPA, MnBP, and behavior in boys are consistent with previous ﬁndings. Further health impact assessment studies based on dose–response functions corrected for exposure misclassiﬁcation are required to quantify the public health burden possibly entailed by such associations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1314},

	abstract = {Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high-production-volume chemical associated with a wide range of health outcomes in animal and human studies. BPA is used as a developer in thermal paper products, including cash register receipt paper; however, little is known about exposure of cashiers to BPA and alternative compounds in receipt paper.
Objective: We determined whether handling receipt paper results in measurable absorption of BPA or the BPA alternatives bisphenol S (BPS) and 4-hydroxyphenyl 4-isoprooxyphenylsulfone (BPSIP).
Methods: Cashiers (n = 77) and non-cashiers (n = 25) were recruited from the Raleigh–Durham–Chapel Hill region of North Carolina during 2011–2013. Receipts were analyzed for the presence of BPA or alternatives considered for use in thermal paper. In cashiers, total urine and serum BPA, BPS, and BPSIP levels in post-shift samples (collected ≤ 2 hr after completing a shift) were compared with pre-shift samples. Levels of these compounds in urine from cashiers were compared to levels in urine from non-cashiers.
Results: Each receipt contained 1–2\% by weight of the paper of BPA, BPS, or BPSIP. The postshift geometric mean total urinary BPS concentration was significantly higher than the pre-shift mean in 33 cashiers who handled receipts containing BPS. The mean urine BPA concentrations in 31 cashiers who handled BPA receipts were as likely to decrease as to increase after a shift, but the mean post-shift concentrations were significantly higher than those in non-cashiers. BPSIP was detected more frequently in the urine of cashiers handling BPSIP receipts than in the urine of noncashiers. Only a few cashiers had detectable levels of total BPA or BPS in serum, whereas BPSIP tended to be detected more frequently.

	abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure during early life may have endocrine-disrupting effects, but the dietary and sociodemographic predictors of BPA exposure during pregnancy and childhood remain unclear. Our aim was to evaluate the correlations between, and sociodemographic and dietary predictors of, serial urinary BPA concentrations measured during pregnancy and childhood in a Spanish birth cohort study. BPA was measured in two spot urine samples collected from 479 women during the ﬁrst and third trimester of pregnancy and in one urine sample from their 4-year old children (n = 130). Average dietary intakes were reported in food frequency questionnaires during the ﬁrst and third pregnancy trimester and at age 4 years. Multivariate mixed models and linear regression models were used to estimate associations between sociodemographic and dietary factors and BPA concentrations. A small, but statistically signiﬁcant correlation was found between serial maternal BPA concentrations measured during pregnancy (r = 0.17). Pregnant women who were younger, less-educated, smoked, and who were exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke (SHS) had higher BPA concentrations than others. BPA concentrations were also higher in children exposed to SHS. High consumption of canned ﬁsh during pregnancy was associated with 21\% [GM ratio = 1.21; 95\%CI 1.02, 1.44] and 25\% [GM ratio = 1.25; 95\%CI 1.05, 1.49] higher urinary BPA concentrations in the ﬁrst and third pregnancy trimester, respectively, compared to the lowest consumption group. This study suggests that canned ﬁsh may be a major source of BPA during pregnancy in Spain, a country of high canned ﬁsh consumption. Further evaluation of speciﬁc BPA exposure sources in the sociodemographic group of younger women who smoke, are exposed to SHS, and have a low educational level is needed. Studies identifying sources of exposure would beneﬁt from repeat BPA measurements and questionnaires speciﬁcally focused on dietary and packaging sources.},

	abstract = {The use of human biomonitoring data to characterize exposure to environmental contaminants in epidemiology studies has expanded greatly in recent years. Substantial variability in effect measures may arise when using different exposure metrics for a given contaminant, and it is often not clear which metric is the best surrogate for the ‘causal’ or ‘true’ exposure. Here we evaluated variability and potential bias in epidemiologic associations resulting from the use of different phthalate exposure metrics in the 2009–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We examined associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and the outcomes of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). We examined each of the following NHANES-derived exposure metrics for metabolites of individual phthalates: molar excretion rate (nmol/min), molar amount (nmol), molar concentration (nmol/mL, with and without additional model adjustment for creatinine), creatinine corrected molar concentration (nmol/g creatinine), and reconstructed daily phthalate intake (nmol/kg/day). In order to investigate potential biasing effect of each metric, we ﬁrst assumed that daily intake of the parent phthalate is the causal exposure. We then constructed a simulated population based on the 2009–2010 NHANES, and randomly assigned each individual a di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) intake dose based on a published distribution, but independent of any other factor. Accordingly, all associations between these randomly assigned intake doses and individuals' BMI and WC should be null. Next, demographic data in the NHANES were incorporated into a pharmacokinetic model to predict urinary molar excretions of ﬁve DEHP metabolites based on the randomly assigned DEHP intake. The predicted molar excretions were then used to calculate the same exposure metrics listed above. Three exposure metrics (randomly generated intake, excretion rate, urine concentration) showed no signiﬁcant associations with BMI, which supports the null hypothesis stated above. In contrast, metrics adjusted for creatinine showed a signiﬁcant negative correlation, and reconstructed daily intake showed a signiﬁcant positive correlation, indicating the introduction of bias away from the true (i.e., null) association. Interestingly, trends in the simulation analysis were similar to those seen in the observed NHANES data. Our ﬁndings show that, at least in this example case, the choice of exposure metric can introduce signiﬁcant bias of varying magnitude and direction into the calculation of epidemiologic associations.},

	volume = {2},
	abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research ﬁndings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientiﬁc ﬁeld. In this framework, a research ﬁnding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a ﬁeld are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater ﬂexibility in designs, deﬁnitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater ﬁnancial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientiﬁc ﬁeld in chase of statistical signiﬁcance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientiﬁc ﬁelds, claimed research ﬁndings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

	abstract = {Methods: As part of the 6-monthly home-based trial rounds, a sexual behaviour individual questionnaire was administered to all residents at least 16 years. We considered seven indicators: sexual intercourse in the past month; at least one regular sexual partner in the past 6 months; at least one casual sexual partner in the past 6 months and more than one sexual partner in the past 6 months; condom use at last sex (CLS) with regular partner, CLS with casual partner, and point prevalence estimate of concurrency. We conducted repeated cross-sectional analyses, stratiﬁed by sex. Generalized Estimating Equations models were used, including trial arm, trial time, calendar time and interaction between trial arm and trial time.
Results: CLS with regular partner varied between 29–51\% and 23–46\% for men and women, respectively, with signiﬁcantly lower odds among women in the control vs. intervention arm by trial end (P {\textless} 0.001). CLS with casual partner among men showed a signiﬁcant interaction between arm and trial round, with no consistent pattern. Women declared more than one partner in the past 6 months in less than 1\% of individual questionnaires; among men, rates varied between 5–12\%, and odds signiﬁcantly and continuously declined between calendar rounds 1 and 7 [odds ratio ¼ 4.2 (3.24–5.45)].
Conclusion: Universal Test and Treat was not associated with increased sexual risk behaviours.},

	abstract = {Background: Prenatal exposure to certain xenobiotics has been associated with adverse birth outcomes. We examined the associations of triclocarban, phenols and parabens in a cohort of 922 pregnant women in Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats Program (PROTECT). Methods: Urinary triclocarban, phenols and parabens were measured at three time points in pregnancy (visit 1: 16–20 weeks, visit 2: 20–24 weeks, visit 3: 24–28 weeks gestation). Multiple linear regression (MLR) models were conducted to regress gestational age and birthweight z-scores against each woman's log average concentrations of exposure biomarkers. Logistic regression models were conducted to calculate odds of preterm birth, small or large for gestational age (SGA and LGA) in association with each of the exposure biomarkers. An interaction term between the average urinary biomarker concentration and infant sex was included in models to identify eﬀect modiﬁcation. The results were additionally stratiﬁed by study visit to look for windows of vulnerability. Results were transformed into the change in the birth outcome for an inter-quartile-range diﬀerence in biomarker concentration (Δ). Results: Average benzophenone-3, methyl- and propyl-paraben concentrations were associated with an increase in gestational age [(Δ 1.90 days; 95\% CI: 0.54, 3.26); (Δ 1.63; 95\% CI: 0.37, 2.89); (Δ 2.06; 95\% CI: 0.63, 3.48), respectively]. Triclocarban was associated with a suggestive 2-day decrease in gestational age (Δ − 1.96; 95\% CI: −4.11, 0.19). Bisphenol A measured at visit 1 was associated with a suggestive increase in gestational age (Δ 1.37; 95\% CI: −0.05, 2.79). Triclosan was positively associated with gestational age among males, and negatively associated with gestational age among females. Methyl-, butyl- and propyl-paraben were associated with signiﬁcant 0.50–0.66 decreased odds of SGA. BPS was associated with an increase in the odds of SGA at visit 3, and a suggestive increase in the odds of LGA at visit 1. Conclusion: Benzophenone-3, methylparaben and propyl-paraben were associated with an increase in gestational age. Concentrations of triclocarban, which were much higher than reported in other populations, were associated with a suggestive decrease in gestational age. The direction of the association between triclosan and gestational age diﬀered by infant sex. Parabens were associated with a decrease in SGA, and BPS was associated with both SGA and LGA depending on the study visit. Further studies are required to substantiate these ﬁndings.},

	abstract = {Background: Triclosan is an antimicrobial chemical used in consumer products, and exposure is ubiquitous among pregnant women in the United States. Triclosan may reduce the levels of thyroid hormones that are important for fetal growth and development.
Objective: We investigated the relationship of prenatal triclosan exposure with birth anthropometry and gestational duration.
Methods: We used data from 378 mother-child pairs participating in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study, a prospective pregnancy and birth cohort from Cincinnati, OH. We measured triclosan concentrations in maternal urine samples collected at 16 and 26 weeks of pregnancy. We abstracted information on neonatal anthropometry and gestational duration from medical records. We used multivariable linear regression to estimate the covariate-adjusted association between the average of the two urinary triclosan concentrations and gestational age standardized weight z-score, length, head circumference, and gestational age at birth.
Results: Median urinary triclosan concentrations were 16 ng/mL (range: {\textless} 2.4 to 1501 ng/mL). Each 10-fold increase in triclosan was associated with a predicted 0.15 standard deviation decrease (95\% CI: −0.30, 0.00) in birth weight z-score, 0.4-cm decrease (95\% CI: −0.8, 0.1) in birth length, 0.3-cm decrease (95\% CI: −0.5, 0.0) in head circumference, and 0.3-week decrease (95\% CI: −0.6, −0.1) in gestational age. Child sex did not modify the associations between triclosan and birth outcomes.
Conclusions: In this cohort, maternal urinary triclosan concentrations during pregnancy were inversely associated with infants’ birth weight, length, head circumference, and gestational age.},

	abstract = {Environmental phenols are used commonly in personal care products and exposure is widespread in pregnant women. In this study, we sought to assess the association between maternal urinary phenol concentrations in pregnancy and fetal growth. The study population included 476 mothers who participated in the prospective LIFECODES birth cohort between 2006 and 2008 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Dichlorophenols (DCPs), benzophenone-3, parabens, triclosan, triclocarban, and bisphenol-S were measured in urine from three time points during pregnancy and averaged. Outcome measures were all standardized to create gestational-age speciﬁc z-scores and included: 1) birth weight; 2) ultrasound parameters measured at up to two time points in pregnancy (head and abdominal circumference and femur length); and 3) ultrasound estimates of fetal weight from two time points in combination with birth weight. Models were stratiﬁed to investigate sex diﬀerences. Inverse associations were observed between average 2,4- and 2,5-DCP concentrations and birth weight z-scores in males. For example, an interquartile range diﬀerence in 2,4-DCP was associated with a 0.18 standard deviation decrease in birth weight z-score (95\% conﬁdence interval [CI] = −0.33, −0.02). These associations were observed in models that included repeated ultrasound estimates of fetal weight during gestation as well. Also in males, we noted inverse associations between average triclosan exposure over pregnancy and estimated fetal weight combined with birth weight in repeated measures models. For females, associations were generally null. However, mothers with a detectable concentration of bisphenol-S at any of the study visits had lower weight females. In conclusion, we observed inverse associations between indicators of maternal phenol exposure during pregnancy and fetal growth, with several diﬀerences observed by sex.},

	abstract = {Background: Prior studies suggest associations between maternal exposure to antimicrobial and paraben compounds with birth outcomes. We have previously reported elevated levels of these compounds for a cohort of mothers and neonates.
Objective: We examined the relationship between human exposure to parabens and antimicrobial compounds and birth outcomes including birth weight, length and head size, and gestational age.
Methods: Maternal urinary and umbilical cord blood plasma concentrations of methylparaben (MePB), ethylparaben (EtPB), propylparaben (PrPB), butylparaben (BuPB), benzylparaben (BePB), triclosan (2,4,4’-trichloro-2’-hydroxydiphenyl ether or TCS) and triclocarban (1-(4chlorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) urea or TCC), were measured in 185 mothers and 34 paired singleton neonates in New York, 2007-2009.
Results: In regression models adjusting for confounders, BuPB levels in plasma were associated with decreased birth weight (β = -592.91, 95\% CI -1094.09, -91.72), PrPB levels with decreased length at birth (β = -1.22, 95\% CI -2.25, -0.18), and TCC and BuPB levels with decreased gestational age at delivery (β = -2.22, 95\% CI -3.87, 0.57, and β = -2.47, 95\% CI -4.45, -0.49, respectively).
Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence of associations between antimicrobials and adverse birth outcomes in neonates. Findings are consistent with animal data suggesting endocrine-disrupting potential resulting in developmental and reproductive toxicity.},

	abstract = {Background: It is of interest to know whether early pregnancy exposure to phenols such as bisphenol-A (BPA) or triclosan (TCS) negatively impacts birth weight outcomes. Exposure to these chemicals is widespread in the Canadian population but obtaining accurate measurements of average exposure is diﬃcult because these chemicals are rapidly excreted from the body, causing body levels to ﬂuctuate both within and between days, as observed in a recent Canadian study (P4). This measurement error can attenuate the estimated eﬀects of exposures.
Methods: Data from two Canadian cohort studies, the Plastics and Personal-care Products use in Pregnancy (P4) Study and the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, such that all participants with complete BPA or TCS exposure and outcome data were used (MIREC n = 1822, P4 n = 68). We used regression calibration to correct for the attenuating eﬀects of exposure measurement error when modeling the eﬀect of ﬁrst trimester BPA or TCS exposure on four birth weight outcomes: birth weight (BW), low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA). Speciﬁc gravity, time of day, and time since last urine void were also controlled in the analysis.
Results: TCS exposure has a marginally signiﬁcant association with SGA only with odds ratio 0.87 and 95\% conﬁdence interval (0.74, 1.00). It also has a marginally signiﬁcant association with LGA in male oﬀspring with odds ratio 1.11 and 95\% conﬁdence interval (1.00, 1.25). The eﬀects of BPA on the four birth outcomes were insigniﬁcant.
Conclusions: Increased TCS exposure during pregnancy is marginally associated with decreased odds of having SGA oﬀspring. It is possibly associated with decreased BW in males and decreased odds of LBW, though these associations were not present in measurement error corrected models. TCS is possibly associated with increased odds in male oﬀspring of being LGA, though this relationship was not present in models not corrected for measurement error. The study ﬁnds no signiﬁcant eﬀects of BPA on birth weight outcomes, which may be due to more severe measurement error in a single observation of BPA.},

	abstract = {Bisphenol S (BPS) has been progressively used due to the potential safety problems of bisphenol A (BPA). Thus Human studies are needed to investigate the developmental effects of BPS. In this study, the impact of maternal BPS exposure on birth outcomes was evaluated with linear and logistic regression models. BPS was analyzed in spot urine samples collected from 985 pregnant women at admission to labor. It was found in 93.7\% of the urine samples with the speciﬁc gravity adjusted geometric mean concentration of 0.17 mg/L. One ln-unit increase in urinary BPS was associated with a 0.72-day increase in pregnancy duration (95\% CI: 0.34, 1.09). When stratiﬁed by fetal sex, each ln-unit increase in maternal urinary BPS was signiﬁcantly correlated with increased gestational age [adjusted b ¼ 1.02, 95\% conﬁdence intervals (CI): 0.47, 1.57] and increased odds of late term birth [adjusted odds ratio ¼ 1.29, 95\% CI: 1.00, 1.67] for girls, but not signiﬁcantly for boys. Including maternal urinary BPA and BPS in one model did not change the results. Associations of BPS with birth weight or length were not observed. This is the ﬁrst report about BPS exposure for pregnant women from China. Higher maternal urinary BPS concentrations were associated with increased gestational age, suggesting maternal BPS exposure may interfere with pregnancy duration. The ﬁndings require replication but reveal the probable risks posed by the developmental BPS exposure.},

We recruited 284 healthy pregnant women, of whom 262 provided both cord blood and placenta samples, and 200 had all measurements taken. Placental Cd, cord blood BPA and total PCBs in the exposed group were higher than a reference group. KISS1 expression level in placental tissue was threefold higher in the exposed group than in the reference, and was positively associated with all toxicants. Leptin and leptin receptor expression were also signiﬁcantly higher, but were only associated with BPA.

	abstract = {Background: Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been associated with adverse birth ­outcomes, but findings of previous studies have been inconsistent.
Objective: We investigated the relation of prenatal BPA exposure with intrauterine growth and evaluated the effect of the number of measurements per subject on observed associations.
Methods: This study was embedded in a Dutch population-based prospective cohort study, with urine samples collected during early, mid-, and late pregnancy. The study comprised 219 women, of whom 99 had one measurement, 40 had two measurements, and 80 had three measurements of urinary BPA. Fetal growth characteristics were repeatedly measured by ultrasound during pregnancy and combined with measurements at birth. Linear regression models for repeated measurements of both BPA and fetal growth were used to estimate associations between urinary concentrations of creatinine-based BPA (BPACB) and intrauterine growth.
Results: The relationship between BPACB and fetal growth was sensitive to the number of BPA measurements per woman. Among 80 women with three BPA measurements, women with BPACB {\textgreater} 4.22 μg/g crea (creatinine) had lower growth rates for fetal weight and head circumference than did women with BPACB {\textless} 1.54 μg/g crea, with estimated differences in mean values at birth of –683 g (20.3\% of mean) and –3.9 cm (11.5\% of mean), respectively. When fewer measurements were available per woman, the exposure–response relationship became progressively attenuated and statistically nonsignificant.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that maternal urinary BPA may impair fetal growth. Because previous studies have shown contradictory findings, further evidence is needed to corroborate these findings in the general population.},

Objectives: To examine maternal exposure to UV filters, associations with maternal thyroid hormone, with growth factor concentrations as well as to birth outcomes.
Methods: Prospective study of 183 pregnant women with 2nd trimester serum and urine samples available. Maternal concentrations of the chemical UV filters benzophenone-1 (BP-1) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) in urine and 4-hydroxy-benzophenone (4-HBP) in serum were measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The relationships between 2nd trimester maternal concentrations of the three chemical UV filters and maternal serum concentrations of thyroid hormones and growth factors, as well as birth outcomes (weight, height, and head and abdominal circumferences) were examined.
Results: Positive associations between maternal serum concentrations of 4-HBP and triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and its binding protein IGFBP3 were observed in mothers carrying male fetuses. Male infants of mothers in the middle 4-HBP exposure group had statistically significantly lower weight and shorter head and abdominal circumferences at birth compared to the low exposure group.
Conclusions: Widespread exposure of pregnant women to chemical UV filters and the possible impact on maternal thyroid hormones and growth factors, and on fetal growth, calls for further studies on possible long-term consequences of the exposure to UV filters on fetal development and children’s health.},

Large concentrations of similar phenolic compounds have been detected in urine, amniotic ﬂuid, and placental tissue, thereby raising questions about its impact on reproduction. The objective of this paper was to investigate the reproductive toxicity of BP-3 in humans and animals. In humans, studies showed that high levels of BP-3 exposure could be linked to an increase in male birth weight but a decline in female birth weight and male gestational age. In ﬁsh, BP-3 exposure resulted in a decline in egg production, hatching, and testosterone, along with a down-regulation of steroidogenic genes. In rats, a decrease in epididymal sperm density and a prolonged estrous cycle for females was observed. These positive associations may be attributed to an altered estrogen and testosterone balance as a result of endocrine disrupting effects of BP-3. However, the current body of literature is limited by non-uniform exposure and outcome measurements in studies both across and within species and future studies will need to be conducted in a standardized fashion to allow for a more signiﬁcant contribution to the literature that allows for better comparison across studies.},

	abstract = {Background: Higher birth weight is an important adverse outcome associated with hyperglycemia in pregnancy. Recent studies suggest that phthalate exposure is associated with elevated glucose levels in pregnant women, with implications for higher birth weight in the offspring. No study to date has investigated the association between prenatal phthalate exposure on infant high birth weight accounting for the range of pregnancy glucose levels.
Methods: A total of 350 women participating in an ongoing pregnancy cohort had data available on urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations at up to four time points across pregnancy. Urinary phthalate metabolites were averaged across pregnancy and log-transformed, specific gravity-adjusted and analyzed in quartiles. Birth weight was examined continuously (in grams), as well as dichotomized as large for gestational age ({\textgreater} 90th percentile). Glucose levels were assessed based on Results from 50-g glucose challenge tests as a part of screening for gestational diabetes conducted at 24–28 weeks gestation, and grouped into 3 categories {\textless} 120 mg/dL, 120– {\textless} 140 mg/dL and ≥140 mg/dL. Multivariable linear regression was performed, adjusting for potential confounders in the overall population and stratified by pregnancy glucose levels.
Results: Approximately 20\% of infants born to women with glucose levels ≥140 mg/dL were large for gestational age. Average mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) concentrations were higher among women who had glucose levels ≥140 mg/dL (geometric mean 140.9 μg/L; 95\% CI: 91.6–216.8); however, higher MEP concentrations were not associated with higher birth weight. When stratified by maternal glucose levels, there was a suggestive association between higher concentrations of mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP) and higher birth weight among women with glucose levels ≥140 mg/dL (adj. birth weight: 569.2 g; 95\% CI: 14.1, 1178.2).
Conclusions: Higher urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations were not significantly associated with higher birth weight. Counter to our hypothesis, women with higher glucose levels and higher urinary phthalate metabolites did not deliver babies with higher birth weight.},

	abstract = {A prospective cohort study of a Chinese population of mothereneonate pairs (n ¼ 3103) was conducted to investigate the relationship between the cumulative hazard index (HI) of combined diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), dibenzyl phthalate (BBzP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure and birth outcomes. The estimated HI for phthalates was based on phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine collected between 5th and 14th gestational weeks. The median HI values according to the European Food Safety Authority tolerable daily intake (HITDI) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reference dose (HIRfD) were 0.358 and 0.187, respectively. A total of 16.3\% and 1.9\% of the women exhibited HITDI and HIRfD exceeding the value of one, respectively. In unadjusted models, the categories (low {\textless} P25, median P25eP50, high {\textgreater} P75) of HITDI were associated with decreased birth weight (b ¼ À26.34 g, p ¼ 0.021) and head circumference (b ¼ À0.09 cm, p ¼ 0.029), whereas those for HIRfD were negatively associated with birth weight (b ¼ À31.74 g, p ¼ 0.005), birth length (b ¼ À0.11 cm, p ¼ 0.032), head circumference (b ¼ À0.13 cm, p ¼ 0.003) and chest circumference (b ¼ À0.10 cm, p ¼ 0.021) in all neonates. Adjustment for potential confounders revealed that HIRfD was inversely associated with head circumference (b ¼ À0.10 cm, p ¼ 0.020). Stratiﬁcation by gender indicated that HIRfD was associated with decreased birth length (b ¼ À0.17 cm, p ¼ 0.041) in infant boys and HITDI was associated with decreased birth weight (b ¼ À33.12 g, p ¼ 0.036) and head circumference (b ¼ À0.13 cm, p ¼ 0.027) in girls. This is the ﬁrst study on the cumulative risk assessment of phthalate exposures in pregnant Chinese women. We found that the HI values of multiple phthalate co-exposure were sexspeciﬁcally related to birth outcomes.},

	abstract = {The Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children’s Health is an ongoing study consisting of two birth cohorts of different population sizes: the Sapporo cohort and the Hokkaido cohort. Our primary study goals are (1) to examine the effects of low-level environmental chemical exposures on birth outcomes, including birth defects and growth retardation; (2) to follow the development of allergies, infectious diseases, and neurobehavioral developmental disorders and perform a longitudinal observation of child development; (3) to identify high-risk groups based on genetic susceptibility to environmental chemicals; and (4) to identify the additive effects of various chemicals, including tobacco smoking. The purpose of this report is to update the progress of the Hokkaido Study, to summarize the recent results, and to suggest future directions. In particular, this report provides the basic characteristics of the cohort populations, discusses the population remaining in the cohorts and those who were lost to follow-up at birth, and introduces the newly added follow-up studies and case-cohort study design. In the Sapporo cohort of 514 enrolled pregnant women, various specimens, including maternal and cord blood, maternal hair, and breast milk, were collected for the assessment of exposures to dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, perfluoroalkyl substances, phthalates, bisphenol A, and methylmercury. As follow-ups, face-to-face neurobehavioral developmental tests were conducted at several different ages. In the Hokkaido cohort of 20,926 enrolled pregnant women, the prevalence of complicated pregnancies and birth outcomes, such as miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, preterm birth, and small for gestational age were examined. The levels of exposure to environmental chemicals were relatively low in these study populations compared to those reported previously. We also studied environmental chemical exposure in association with health outcomes, including birth size, neonatal hormone levels, neurobehavioral development, asthma, allergies, and infectious diseases. In addition, genetic and epigenetic analyses were conducted. The results of this study demonstrate the effects of environmental chemical exposures on genetically susceptible populations and on DNA methylation. Further study and continuous follow-up are necessary to elucidate the combined effects of chemical exposure on health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Genomic imprinting leads to parent-of-origin speciﬁc gene expression and is determined by epigenetic modiﬁcation of genes. The paternally expressed gene insulin-like growth-factor 2 (IGF2) is located about \$ 100 kb from the maternally expressed non-coding gene H19 on human chromosome 11, and both genes play major roles in embryonic and placental growth. Given adverse gestational environments can inﬂuence DNA methylation patterns in extra-embryonic tissues, we hypothesized that prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) alters H19 and IGF2 methylation in placenta. Our study was restricted to a total of 196 women co-enrolled in the Predictors of Preeclampsia Study and the Harvard Epigenetic Birth Cohort. First trimester urine concentrations of 8 phenols and 11 phthalate metabolites were measured and used to characterize EDC exposure proﬁles. We assessed methylation of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by pyrosequencing of H19, IGF2DMR0, and IGF2DMR2 and correlated values with phenol and phthalate metabolites. We also assessed overall expression and allele-speciﬁc expression of H19 and IGF2. We found several signiﬁcant associations between DNA methylation and additive biomarker measurements. A signiﬁcant decrease in H19 methylation was associated with high levels of the sum (Σ) of phthalate metabolites and metabolites of low molecular weight (LMW) phthalates. Σphthalate and LMW phthalate concentrations were inversely associated with IGF2DMR0 methylation values. Variation in methylation was not associated with changes in allele-speciﬁc expression. However increased deviation of allele-speciﬁc expression of H19 was associated with Σdi (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites and high molecular weight phthalates. Neither methylation nor expression of these imprinted regions had a signiﬁcant impact on birth length or birth weight. Overall, our study provides new insight into an epigenetic mechanism that occurs following EDC exposure.},

Methods: A total of 126 mother–newborn pairs, including 42 IUGR cases and 84 control newborns and their mothers, were enrolled in this case–control study. Spot urine samples were collected during the third trimester of pregnancy, and 5 phthalate metabolites (mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), monomethyl phthalate (MMP), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), and mono(2ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP)) were measured.
Results: Concentrations of MMP, MEHHP, MEOHP, and SumDEHP (MEHP, MEHHP, and MEOHP) were significantly higher in IUGR cases than in normal controls. In all subjects, urinary concentrations of MEHHP and MEOHP were significantly inversely associated with fetal growth indicators (birth weight and Quetelet’s index). When mothers were stratified by infant sex, MEHHP and MEOHP concentrations were still negatively associated with fetal growth indicators, while no significant association was observed in females. In addition, exposure–response relationships were observed between MEHHP/ SumDEHP concentrations in maternal urine and IUGR.
Conclusion: Prenatal exposure to phthalates was associated with increased risk of IUGR, and male newborns were more sensitive to phthalates than females.},

	abstract = {Background: Anogenital distance (AGD) and the second to fourth ﬁnger (2D:4D) digit ratio may be early markers of in utero androgen exposure for the infant. Phthalates and phenols have been identiﬁed as endocrine disrupting chemicals.
Objectives: To study the association between prenatal exposure to phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA) and triclosan (TCS) and AGD and the 2D:4D digit ratios.
Methods: Single spot urine samples were collected in the ﬁrst trimester from the MIREC Study and analyzed for phthalates and phenols. Anogenital distance (n = 394) at birth and 2D:4D digit ratios (n = 420) at 6 months were measured in male and female infants. Associations between maternal concentrations of phenols and phthalate metabolites and these outcomes were estimated using multiple linear regression models.
Results: In females, the anoclitoris distance (ACD) was negatively associated with mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) (β = −1.24; 95\% CI −1.91, −0.57) and positively associated with mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) (β = 0.65; 95\% CI 0.12, 1.18) (masculinizing). In males, anopenile distance (APD) was positively associated with mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) (β = 1.17; 95\% CI 0.02, 2.32) and the molar sum of low molecular weight phthalates (ΣLMW). Female 2D:4D of the right hand was positively associated with MnBP and negatively with total BPA (masculinizing).
Conclusions: Signiﬁcant associations were only observed for the long AGD metrics. Positive associations were observed between MnBP or LMW phthalates and APD in males. In females, prenatal MEP was associated with a masculinizing eﬀect on ACD, while MBzP was associated with a feminizing eﬀect. No signiﬁcant associations were observed between prenatal phenols and AGD. Given the paucity of research on digit ratios and prenatal chemical exposures, it is diﬃcult to say whether this metric will be a useful marker of prenatal androgen or antiandrogen exposure. Given the large number of associations examined, the statistical associations observed may have been due to Type 1 error. The inconsistencies in results between studies suggest that this issue is yet to be resolved.},

	abstract = {Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates are ubiquitous non-persistent endocrine disrupting chemicals whose relation with infant birth size is not clearly understood.
Methods: We examined associations between maternal and paternal preconception urinary concentrations of total BPA and 14 phthalate metabolites and birth size for 233 infants. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate parental quartiles of BPA and phthalates in relation to birth weight, length, head circumference, and ponderal index with separate models run for each parent adjusting for age, smoking, body mass index, education, alcohol, parity, and creatinine. Models also included an interaction term for each chemical and infant sex and were further adjusted to include the other partner’s chemical concentrations.
Results: In maternal models adjusted for partner’s exposure and covariates, reductions in birth weight (range: 178-215 g; p {\textless} 0.05) were observed for the 2nd quartile of maternal monomethyl phthalate, mono-[(2-carboxymethyl) hexyl] phthalate and mono-n-octyl phthalate when compared with the 1st quartiles. The 3rd quartile of monoethylhexyl phthalate (mEHP) was also associated with a 200.16 g (95 \% CI: -386.90, -13.42) reduction. Similar reductions in birth weight were observed for the 2nd quartile of paternal mEHP (β = -191.93 g; 95 \% CI: -381.61, -2.25). Additionally, select maternal urinary metabolites were associated with decreased head circumference, birth length and gestational age. However, paternal concentrations were generally associated with increased birth length and gestational age.
Conclusions: We observed some suggestion that preconception maternal and paternal urinary concentration of BPA and specific phthalate metabolites may be associated with smaller birth size and increased gestational age, though the findings appeared to be parent and chemical specific.},

	abstract = {Background: It is of critical importance to evaluate the role of environmental chemical exposures in premature birth. While a number of studies investigate this relationship, most utilize single exposure measurements during pregnancy in association with the outcome. The studies with repeated measures of exposure during pregnancy employ primarily cross-sectional analyses that may not be fully leveraging the power and additional information that the data provide.
Methods: We examine 9 statistical methods that may be utilized to estimate the relationship between a longitudinal exposure and a binary, non-time-varying outcome. To exemplify these methods we utilized data from a nested case–control study examining repeated measures of urinary phthalate metabolites during pregnancy in association with preterm birth.
Results: The methods summarized may be useful for: 1) Examining sensitive windows of exposure in association with an outcome; 2) Summarizing repeated measures to estimate the relationship between average exposure and an outcome; 3) Identifying acute exposures that may be relevant to the outcome; and 4) Understanding the contribution of temporal patterns in exposure levels to the outcome of interest. In the study of phthalates, changes in urinary metabolites over pregnancy did not appear to contribute significantly to preterm birth, making summary of average exposure across gestation optimal given the current design.
Conclusions: The methods exemplified may be of great use in future epidemiologic research projects intended to: 1) Elucidate the complex relationships between environmental chemical exposures and preterm birth; 2) Investigate biological mechanisms in prematurity using repeated measures of maternal factors throughout pregnancy; and 3) More generally, address the relationship between a longitudinal predictor and a binary, non-time-varying outcome.},

	abstract = {Background: Pregnant women are exposed to a mixture of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Gestational EDC exposures may be associated with changes in fetal growth that elevates the risk for poor health later in life, but few studies have examined the health effects of simultaneous exposure to multiple chemicals. This study aimed to examine the association of gestational exposure to five chemical classes of potential EDCs: phthalates and bisphenol A, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) with infant birth weight.
Methods: Using data from the Health Outcomes and Measures of Environment (HOME) Study, we examined 272 pregnant women enrolled between 2003-2006. EDC concentrations were quantified in blood and urine samples collected at 16 and 26 weeks gestation. We used Bayesian Hierarchical Linear Models (BHLM) to examine the associations between newborn birth weight and 53 EDCs, 2 organochlorine pesticides (OPPs) and 2 heavy metals.
Results: For a 10-fold increase in chemical concentration, the mean differences in birth weights (95\% credible intervals (CI)) were 1 g (-20, 23) for phthalates, -11 g (-52, 34) for PFAS, 0.2 g (-9, 10) for PCBs, -4 g (-30, 22) for PBDEs, and 7 g (-25, 40) for OCPs.
Conclusion: Gestational exposure to phthalates, PFAS, PCBs, PBDEs, OCPs or OPPs had null or small associations with birth weight. Gestational OPP, Pb, and PFAS exposures were most strongly associated with lower birth weight.},

Our study estimated the effects of exposure to single pollutants and mixtures on birth weight in 248 mother-child pairs. Arsenic, copper, lead, manganese and thallium were measured in cord blood, cadmium in maternal blood, methylmercury in maternal hair, and ﬁve organochlorines, two perﬂuorinated compounds and diethylhexyl phthalate metabolites in cord plasma. Daily exposure to particulate matter was modeled and averaged over the duration of gestation. In single pollutant models, arsenic was signiﬁcantly associated with reduced birth weight. The effect estimate increased when including cadmium, and mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP) co-exposure. Combining exposures by principal component analysis generated an exposure factor loaded by cadmium and arsenic that was associated with reduced birth weight. MECPP induced gender speciﬁc effects. In girls, the effect estimate was doubled with co-exposure of thallium, PFOS, lead, cadmium, manganese, and mercury, while in boys, the mixture of MECPP with cadmium showed the strongest association with birth weight. In conclusion, birth weight was consistently inversely associated with exposure to pollutant mixtures. Chemicals not showing signiﬁcant associations at single pollutant level contributed to stronger effects when analyzed as mixtures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many phthalates and phenols are hormonally active and are suspected to alter the course of development.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated prenatal exposures to phthalate and phenol metabolites and their associations with body size measures of the infants at birth.
METHODS: We measured 5 phenol and 10 phthalate urinary metabolites in a multiethnic cohort of 404 women in New York City during their third trimester of pregnancy and recorded size of infants at birth.
RESULTS: Median urinary concentrations were {\textgreater} 10 µg/L for 2 of 5 phenols and 6 of 10 phthalate monoester metabolites. Concentrations of low-molecular-weight phthalate monoesters (low-MWP) were approximately 5-fold greater than those of high-molecular-weight metabolites. Low-MWP metabolites had a positive association with gestational age [0.97 day gestational age per ln-biomarker; 95\% conﬁdence interval (CI), 0.07–1.9 days, multivariate adjusted] and with head circumference. Higher prenatal exposures to 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-DCP) predicted lower birth weight in boys (–210 g average birth weight difference between the third tertile and ﬁrst tertile of 2,5-DCP; 95\% CI, 71–348 g). Higher maternal benzophenone-3 (BP3) concentrations were associated with a similar decrease in birth weight among girls but with greater birth weight in boys.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed a range of phthalate and phenol exposures during pregnancy in our population, but few were associated with birth size. The association of 2,5-DCP and BP3 with reduced or increased birth weight could be important in very early or small-size births. In addition, positive associations of urinary metabolites with some outcomes may be attributable partly to unresolved confounding with maternal anthropometric factors.},

Objectives: We investigated whether maternal exposure to BPA during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of infant low birth weight (LBW).
Methods: A total 452 mother-infant pairs (113 LBW cases and 339 matched controls) were selected from the participants enrolled in the prospective Health Baby Cohort (HBC) in Wuhan city, China, during 2012–2014. BPA concentrations were measured in maternal urine samples collected at delivery, and the information of birth outcomes was retrieved from the medical records. A conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between urinary BPA levels and LBW.
Results: Mothers with LBW infants had signiﬁcantly higher urinary BPA levels (median: 4.70 μg/L) than the control mothers (median: 2.25 μg/L) (p b 0.05). Increased risk of LBW was associated with higher maternal urinary levels of BPA [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 3.13 for the medium tertile, 95\% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.21, 8.08; adjusted OR = 2.49 for the highest tertile, 95\% CI: 0.98, 6.36]. The association was more pronounced among female infants than among male infants, with a statistical evidence of heterogeneity in risk (p = 0.03).
Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to higher levels of BPA may potentially increase the risk of delivering LBW infants, especially for female infants. This is the ﬁrst case–control study to examine the association in China. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Objectives: We assessed whether prenatal exposure to BPA and phthalates was associated with fetal growth in a Spanish birth cohort of 488 mother–child pairs.
Methods: We measured BPA and eight phthalates [four di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (DEHPm), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), and three low-molecular-weight phthalate metabolites (LMWPm)] in two spot-urine samples collected during the first and third trimester of pregnancy. We estimated growth curves for femur length (FL), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), biparietal diameter (BPD), and estimated fetal weight (EFW) during pregnancy (weeks 12–20 and 20–34), and for birth weight, birth length, head circumference at birth, and placental weight.
Results: Overall, results did not support associations of exposure to BPA or DEHPm during pregnancy with fetal growth parameters. Prenatal MBzP exposure was positively associated with FL at 20–34 weeks, resulting in an increase of 3.70\% of the average FL (95\% CI: 0.75, 6.63\%) per doubling of MBzP concentration. MBzP was positively associated with birth weight among boys (48 g; 95\% CI: 6, 90) but not in girls (–27 g; 95\% CI: –79, 25) (interaction p-value = 0.04). The LMWPm mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) was negatively associated with HC at 12–20 pregnancy weeks [–4.88\% of HC average (95\% CI: –8.36, –1.36\%)].
Conclusions: This study, one of the first to combine repeat exposure biomarker measurements and multiple growth measures during pregnancy, finds little evidence of associations of BPA or phthalate exposures with fetal growth. Phthalate metabolites MBzP and MnBP were associated with some fetal growth parameters, but these findings require replication.},

DI values ranged between {\textless}LOD and 59.65 mg/kg bw/day depending on the congener, and were globally higher for children than adults. They were compared to acceptable levels of exposure (tolerable daily intakes) to evaluate the hazard quotients (HQ), which highlight an intake above the dose considered as safe for values greater than 1. If very few of our Belgian participants exceeded this threshold for phthalates considered individually, 6.2\% of the adults and 25\% of the children showed an excessive hazard index (HI) which took into account the cumulative risk of adverse anti-androgenic effects. These results are of concern since these HI were based on only 3 phthalates (DEHP, DiBP and DnBP), and showed a median of 0.55 and 0.29 for children and adults respectively. The comparison with previously determined dietary intakes demonstrated that for DEHP, food intake was nearly the only route of exposure while other pathways occurred mainly for the other studied phthalates.},

	abstract = {Background: There are numerous methods for adjusting measured concentrations of urinary biomarkers for hydration variation. Few studies use objective criteria to quantify the relative performance of these methods. Our aim was to compare the performance of existing methods for adjusting urinary biomarkers for hydration variation.
Methods: Creatinine, osmolality, excretion rate (ER), bodyweight adjusted ER (ERBW) and empirical analyte-specific urinary flow rate (UFR) adjustment methods on spot urinary concentrations of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), non-arsenobetaine arsenic (AsIMM) and iodine (I) from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2009–2010 and 2011–2012) were evaluated. The data were divided into a training dataset (n = 1,723) from which empirical adjustment coefficients were derived and a testing dataset (n = 428) on which quantification of the performance of the adjustment methods was done by calculating, primarily, the correlation of the adjusted parameter with UFR, with lower correlations indicating better performance and, secondarily, the correlation of the adjusted parameters with blood analyte concentrations (Pb and Cd), with higher correlations indicating better performance.
Results: Overall performance across analytes was better for Osmolality and UFR based methods. Excretion rate and ERBW consistently performed worse, often no better than unadjusted concentrations.
Conclusions: Osmolality adjustment of urinary biomonitoring data provides for more robust adjustment than either creatinine based or ER or ERBW methods, the latter two of which tend to overcompensate for UFR. Modified UFR methods perform significantly better than all but osmolality in removing hydration variation, but depend on the accuracy of UFR calculations. Hydration adjustment performance is analyte-specific and further research is needed to establish a robust and consistent framework.},

	abstract = {Background: Investigators measuring exposure biomarkers in urine typically adjust for c­reatinine to account for dilution-dependent sample variation in urine concentrations. Similarly, it is standard to adjust for serum lipids when measuring lipophilic chemicals in serum. However, there is controversy regarding the best approach, and existing methods may not effectively correct for measurement error.
Objectives: We compared adjustment methods, including novel approaches, using simulated case–control data.
Methods: Using a directed acyclic graph framework, we defined six causal scenarios for e­ pidemiologic studies of environmental chemicals measured in urine or serum. The scenarios include variables known to influence creatinine (e.g., age and hydration) or serum lipid levels (e.g., body mass index and recent fat intake). Over a range of true effect sizes, we analyzed each scenario using seven adjustment approaches and estimated the corresponding bias and confidence interval coverage across 1,000 simulated studies.
Results: For urinary biomarker measurements, our novel method, which incorporates both covariate-adjusted standardization and the inclusion of creatinine as a covariate in the regression model, had low bias and possessed 95\% confidence interval coverage of nearly 95\% for most simulated scenarios. For serum biomarker measurements, a similar approach involving standardization plus serum lipid level adjustment generally performed well.
Conclusions: To control measurement error bias caused by variations in serum lipids or by urinary diluteness, we recommend improved methods for standardizing exposure concentrations across individuals.},

	abstract = {Background: Identifying windows of vulnerability to environmental toxicants is an important area in children’s health research.
Objective: We compared and contrasted statistical approaches that may help identify windows of vulnerability by formally testing differences in exposure effects across time of exposure, incorporating continuous time metrics for timing of exposure, and efficiently incorporating incomplete cases.
Methods: We considered four methods: 1) window-specific and simultaneously adjusted regression; 2) multiple informant models; 3) using features of individual exposure patterns to predict outcomes; and 4) models of population exposure patterns depending on the outcome. We illustrate them using a study of prenatal vulnerability to lead in relation to Bayley’s Mental Development Index at 24 months of age (MDI24).
Results: The estimated change in MDI24 score with a 1-loge-unit increase in blood lead during the first trimester was –2.74 [95\% confidence interval (CI), –5.78 to 0.29] based on a window-specific regression. The corresponding change in MDI24 was –4.13 (95\% CI, –7.54 to –0.72) based on a multiple informant model; estimated effects were similar across trimesters (p = 0.23). Results from method 3 suggested that blood lead levels in early pregnancy were significantly associated with reduced MDI24, but decreasing blood leads over the course of pregnancy were not. Method 4 results indicated that blood lead levels before 17 weeks of gestation were lower among children with MDI24 scores in the 90th versus the 10th percentile (p = 0.08).
Conclusions: Method 2 is preferred over method 1 because it enables formal testing of differences in effects across a priori–defined windows (e.g., trimesters of pregnancy). Methods 3 and 4 are preferred over method 2 when there is large variability in the timing of exposure assessments among participants. Methods 3 and 4 yielded smaller p-values for tests of the hypothesis that not only level but also timing of lead exposure are relevant predictors of MDI24; systematic power comparisons are warranted.},

	abstract = {Background: Triclosan (TCS) is widely used as an antibacterial agent in consumer products such as hand soap and toothpaste and human exposure is widespread. TCS is suspected of having endocrine disrupting properties, but few human studies have examined the developmental effects of prenatal TCS exposure.
Objectives: To prospectively examine associations between prenatal TCS exposure and anthropometric measures at birth and anogenital distance (AGD) at three months of age.
Methods: Pregnant women from the Odense Child Cohort (n=514) provided urine samples around gestational week 28 (median 28.7 weeks, range 26.4 – 34.0) and urinary TCS concentration was measured by LC-MS/MS. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine associations between prenatal TCS exposure and measures of size at birth (birth weight, length, head and abdominal circumference) and AGD at three months of age (median 3.3 months, range 2.3 to 6.7 months) controlling for potential confounders.
Results: Newborn boys in the highest quartile of prenatal TCS exposure had a 0.7 cm (95\% CI: 1.2, -0.1, p=0.01) smaller head circumference compared with boys in the lowest quartile. Additionally in boys, inverse associations of borderline statistical significance between prenatal TCS exposure and abdominal circumference at birth and AGD at three months were observed (pvalues {\textless}0.10). Prenatal TCS exposure was not significantly associated with any of the outcomes in girls. However, fewer girls had AGD measured and we observed no significant interactions between child sex and prenatal TCS-exposure in anthropometric measures at birth.
Conclusion: Prenatal TCS-exposure was associated with reduced head and abdominal circumference at birth and reduced AGD at three months of age in boys, although the two latter findings were statistically non-significant. These findings require replication, but are compatible with an anti-androgenic effect of prenatal TCS exposure on fetal growth in boys.},

	abstract = {Multicentre studies are common in epidemiological research aiming at identifying disease risk factors. A major advantage of multicentre over single-centre studies is that, by including a larger number of participants, they allow consideration of rare outcomes and exposures. Their multicentric nature introduces some complexities at the step of data analysis, in particular when it comes to controlling for confounding by centre, which is the focus of this tutorial. Commonly, epidemiologists use one of the following options: pooling all centre-speciﬁc data and adjusting for centre using ﬁxed effects; adjusting for centre using random effects; or ﬁtting centre-speciﬁc models and combining the results in a meta-analysis. Here, we illustrate the similarities of and differences between these three modelling approaches, explain the reasons why they may provide different conclusions and offer advice on which model to choose depending on the characteristics of the study. Two key issues to examine during the analyses are to distinguish within-centre from between-centre associations, and the possible heterogeneity of the effects (of exposure and/or confounders) by centre. A real epidemiological study is used to illustrate a situation in which these various options yield different results. A synthetic dataset and R and Stata codes are provided to reproduce the results.},

We illustrate our approach using the BioCycle data where we are interested in the effects of Vitamin E and Beta-carotene on Progesterone levels. We also evaluate the longitudinal impact of changes in Vitamin E on Progesterone levels over time. Finaly, we demonstrate the advantages of using MI over complete case analysis or naive single replacement in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis where measurements below the limit of quantiﬁcation (LOQ) are unreported. We also illustrate that if available, inclusion of potentially demined unreliable data below the limit of detection (LOD) improves simple estimation substantially.},

	abstract = {Background: Raw data on the relationship between known and measured values of an analyte are collected and analyzed to determine the limit of quantiﬁcation (LOQ) of an assay. In most LOQ problems, the researcher is given an observed value for the marker of interest if this value is greater than the LOQ, and a missing value (ϽLOQ) otherwise. From a statistical perspective, the implicit assumption is that there is no measurement error for values greater than the LOQ, and unacceptable measurement error for values less than the LOQ. A more plausible assumption is that there is measurement error throughout the measure’s support.
Methods: We describe a Bayesian measurement error model that yields prediction intervals for the true assay value throughout the range of analyte values, and allows for heteroscedasticity of the measurement errors.
Results: We illustrate our model on calibration data for fat-soluble vitamins, focusing particularly on beta-cryptoxanthin. Prediction intervals for values above the LOQ are wide, and the width increases with the measured value. Prediction intervals below the LOQ provide more information than the statement that the value is less than the LOQ.
Conclusion: The current approach to transmitting data from calibration assays is ﬂawed, since it provides a distorted picture of the actual measurement error. Implications for subsequent analyses of assay measurements are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background—Many laboratory assays measure biomarkers via a 2-stage process. Direct measurement yields relative measures that are subsequently transformed to the unit of interest by using a calibration experiment. The calibration experiment is performed within the main experiment and uses a validation set for which true values are known and relative values are measured by assays to estimate the relation between relative and absolute values. Immunoassays, polymerase chain reaction, and chromatographic approaches are among assays performed in this manner.
Methods—For studies with multiple batches, data from more than a single calibration experiment are available. Conventionally, calibration of assays based on the standard curve is performed specific to each batch; the calibration experiment from each batch is used to calibrate each batch independently. This batch-specific approach incorporates batch variability but, due to the small number of calibration measurements in each batch, may not be best suited for this purpose.
Results—Mixed-effects models have been described to address interassay variability and to provide a measure of quality assurance. Conversely, when interbatch variability is negligible, a model that does not incorporate batch effect may be used to estimate an overall calibration curve.
Conclusion—We explore approaches for use of calibration data in studies with many batches. Using a real data example with biomarker and outcome information, we show that risk estimates may vary depending on the calibration approach utilized. We demonstrate the potential for bias when using simulations. Under minimal interbatch variability, as seen in our data, conventional batch-specific calibration does not best utilize information available in the data and results in attenuated risk estimates.},

Although a large amount of research has been devoted to estimation and inference for data with censored responses, very little research has focused on proper statistical procedures when predictors are censored. In this paper, we consider statistical methods for dealing with multiple predictors subject to detection limits within the context of generalized linear models. We investigate and adapt several conventional methods and develop a new multiple imputation approach for analyzing data sets with predictors censored due to detection limits. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed multiple imputation estimator and suggest a computationally simple and consistent variance estimator. We also demonstrate that the conditional mean imputation method often leads to inconsistent estimates in generalized linear models, while several other methods are either computationally intensive or lead to parameter estimates that are biased or more variable compared to the proposed multiple imputation estimator. In an extensive simulation study, we assess the bias and variability of different approaches within the context of a logistic regression model and compare variance estimation methods for the proposed multiple imputation estimator. Lastly, we apply several methods to analyze the data set from a recently-conducted GenIMS study.},

	abstract = {Background: As part of the perinatal component of the French Human Biomonitoring (HBM) program, biomarkers levels of various chemicals have been described among pregnant women having given birth in continental France in 2011 and who have been enrolled in the Elfe cohort (French Longitudinal Study since Childhood). This paper describes the design of the study and provides main descriptive results regarding exposure biomarkers levels.
Methods: Exposure biomarkers were measured in biological samples collected at delivery from pregnant women randomly selected among the participants in the clinical and biological component of the Elfe cohort (n = 4145). The geometric mean and percentiles of the levels distribution were estimated for each biomarker. The sampling design was taken into account in order to obtain estimates representative of the French pregnant women in 2011.
Results: Results provide a nation-wide representative description of biomarker levels for important environmental contaminants among pregnant women who gave birth in France in 2011. Bisphenol A (BPA), and some metabolites of phthalates, pesticides (mainly pyrethroids), dioxins, furans, polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), brominated ﬂame retardants (BFRs), perﬂuorinated compounds (PFCs) and metals (except uranium) were quantiﬁed in almost 100\% of the pregnant women. Some compounds showed a downward trend compared to previous studies (lead, mercury), but others did not (pyrethroids) and should be further monitored.
Conclusion and perspectives: The present results show that French pregnant women are exposed to a wide variety of pollutants, including some that have been banned or restricted in France. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this article, these approaches from causal inference are further extended to settings in which multiple mediators may be of interest. Two analytic approaches, one based on regression and one based on weighting are proposed to estimate the effect mediated through multiple mediators and the effects through other pathways. The approaches proposed here accommodate exposure–mediator interactions and, to a certain extent, mediator–mediator interactions as well. The methods handle binary or continuous mediators and binary, continuous or count outcomes. When the mediators affect one another, the strategy of trying to assess direct and indirect effects one mediator at a time will in general fail; the approach given in this article can still be used. A characterization is moreover given as to when the sum of the mediated effects for multiple mediators considered separately will be equal to the mediated effect of all of the mediators considered jointly.

	abstract = {Introduction: Prenatal exposure to some phenols and parabens has been associated with adverse birth outcomes. Hormones may play an intermediate role between phenols and adverse outcomes. We examined the associations of phenol and paraben exposures with maternal reproductive and thyroid hormones in 602 pregnant women in Puerto Rico. Urinary triclocarban, phenol and paraben biomarkers, and serum hormones (estriol, progesterone, testosterone, sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), total triiodothyronine (T3), total thyroxine (T4), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)) were measured at two visits during pregnancy.
Methods: Linear mixed models with a random intercept were constructed to examine the associations between hormones and urinary biomarkers. Results were additionally stratified by study visit. Results were transformed to hormone percent changes for an inter-quartile-range difference in exposure biomarker concentrations (\%Δ).
Results: Bisphenol-S was associated with a decrease in CRH [(\%Δ -11.35; 95\% CI: -18.71, − 3.33), and bisphenol-F was associated with an increase in FT4 (\%Δ: 2.76; 95\% CI: 0.29, 5.22). Butyl-, methyl- and propylparaben were associated with decreases in SHBG [(\%Δ: -5.27; 95\% CI: -9.4, − 1.14); (\%Δ: -3.53; 95\% CI: -7.37, 0.31); (\%Δ: -3.74; 95\% CI: -7.76, 0.27)]. Triclocarban was positively associated with T3 (\%Δ: 4.08; 95\% CI: 1.18, 6.98) and T3/T4 ratio (\%Δ: 4.67; 95\% CI: -1.37, 6.65), and suggestively negatively associated with TSH (\%Δ: -10.12; 95\% CI: -19.47, 0.32). There was evidence of susceptible windows of vulnerability for some associations. At 24–28 weeks gestation, there was a positive association between 2,4-dichlorophenol and CRH (\%Δ: 9.66; 95\% CI: 0.67, 19.45) and between triclosan and estriol (\%Δ: 13.17; 95\% CI: 2.34, 25.2); and a negative association between triclocarban and SHBG (\%Δ: -9.71; 95\% CI:-19.1, − 0.27) and between bisphenol A and testosterone (\%Δ: -17.37; 95\% CI: -26.7, − 6.87).
Conclusion: Phenols and parabens are associated with hormone levels during pregnancy. Further studies are required to substantiate these findings.},

This paper presents modeling methods used to estimate exposure distributions of chlorpyrifos and diazinon in the residential microenvironment using the database generated in Arizona (NHEXAS-AZ). A four-stage probability sampling design was used for sample selection. Exposures to pesticides were estimated using the indirect method of exposure calculation by combining measured concentrations of the two pesticides in multiple media with questionnaire information such as time subjects spent indoors, dietary and non-dietary items they consumed, and areas they touched. Most distributions of in-residence exposure to chlorpyrifos and diazinon were log-normal or nearly log-normal. Exposures to chlorpyrifos and diazinon vary by pesticide and route as well as by various demographic characteristics of the subjects. Comparisons of exposure to pesticides were investigated among subgroups of demographic categories, including gender, age, minority status, education, family income, household dwelling type, year the dwelling was built, pesticide use, and carpeted areas within dwellings. Residents with large carpeted areas within their dwellings have higher exposures to both pesticides for all routes than those in less carpet-covered areas. Depending on the route, several other determinants of exposure to pesticides were identi"ed, but a clear pattern could not be established regarding the exposure di!erences between several subpopulation groups. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A knowledge based list of 29 potential exposure determinants was assembled from information obtained from six questionnaires administered in the course of the study. This list was used to select the independent variables of each model statistically and electronically. Depending on the data type of dependent and independent variables, four classes of regression models were developed to determine desired associations. Route - specific exposures were estimated using the indirect method of exposure estimation and measurements from the NHEXAS - AZ field study. The stepwise procedure was used to construct regression models. Significance level at P= 0.10 was used for entry and retention of independent variables in a model. Twelve significant regression models were formulated to quantify associations among exposures and other variables in the NHEXAS - AZ database. Route - specific exposures to pesticides associate significantly with questionnaire - based variables such as preparation of pesticides, use of pesticide inside the house, and income level; and with concentration variables in three media: dermal wipe, sill wipe, and indoor air. Models formulated in this study may be used to estimate exposures to each of the pesticides. Yet, the use of these models must incorporate clear statements of the assumptions made in the formulation as well as the coefficient of determination and the confidence and prediction intervals of the dependent variable.

Objective: Our aim was to assess the relationships between prenatal exposures to phthalates and phenols and fetal growth among male newborns.
Methods: We conducted a case–control study on male malformations of the genitalia nested in two French mother–child cohorts with recruitment between 2002 and 2006. We measured, in maternal urinary samples collected between 6 and 30 gestational weeks, the concentrations (micrograms per liter) of 9 phenol (n = 191 pregnant women) and 11 phthalate metabolites (n = 287). Weight, length, and head circumference at birth were collected from maternity records. Statistical analyses were corrected for the oversampling of malformation cases.
Results: Adjusted birth weight decreased by 77 g [95\% confidence interval (CI): –129, –25] and by 49 g (95\% CI: –86, –13) in association with a 1-unit increase in ln-transformed 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) and 2,5-DCP urinary concentrations, respectively. Benzophenone-3 (BP3) ln-transformed concentrations were positively associated with weight (26 g; 95\% CI: –2, 54) and head circumference at birth (0.1 cm; 95\% CI: 0.0, 0.2). Head circumference increased by 0.3 cm (95\% CI: 0.0, 0.7) in association with a 1-unit increase in ln-transformed BPA concentration. For phthalate metabolites there was no evidence of monotonic associations with birth weight.
Conclusions: Consistent with findings of a previous study, we observed evidence of an inverse association of 2,5-DCP and a positive association of BP3 with male birth weight.},

	abstract = {Background: Studies on airway inﬂammation, measured as fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), have focused on its relation to control of asthma, but the contribution of allergen exposure to the increase in FENO levels is unknown.
Objective: We evaluated (1) whether FENO levels were increased in children with allergic sensitization or asthma; (2) whether speciﬁc allergen exposure increased FENO levels in sensitized, but not unsensitized, children; and (3) whether sedentary behavior increased FENO levels independent of allergen exposures.
Methods: At age 12 years, in a birth cohort of children with a parental history of allergy or asthma, we measured bed dust allergen (dust mite, cat, and cockroach) by means of ELISA, speciﬁc allergic sensitization primarily based on speciﬁc IgE levels, and respiratory disease (current asthma, rhinitis, and wheeze) and hours of television viewing/video game playing by means of questionnaire. Children performed spirometric maneuvers before and after bronchodilator responses and had FENO levels measured by using electrochemical detection methods (NIOX MINO).
Results: FENO levels were increased in children with current asthma (32.2 ppb), wheeze (27.0 ppb), or rhinitis (23.2 ppb) compared with subjects without these respective symptoms/ diagnoses (16.4-16.6 ppb, P {\textless} .005 for all comparisons). Allergic sensitization to indoor allergens (cat, dog, and dust mite) predicted higher FENO levels and explained one third of the variability in FENO levels. FENO levels were highest in children both sensitized and exposed to dust mite. Greater than 10 hours of weekday television viewing was associated with a 0.64-log increase in FENO levels after controlling for indoor allergen exposure, body mass index, and allergic sensitization.
Conclusion: Allergen exposures and sedentary behavior (television viewing/video game playing) might increase airway inﬂammation, which was measured as the FENO. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;127:1165-72.)},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during critical developmental windows have been implicated in the etiologies of a wide array of adverse perinatal and pediatric outcomes. Epidemiological studies have concentrated on the health eﬀects of individual chemicals, despite the understanding that EDCs act together via common mechanisms, that pregnant women are exposed to multiple EDCs simultaneously, and that substantial toxicological evidence of adverse developmental eﬀects has been documented. There is a move toward multipollutant models in environmental epidemiology; however, there is no current consensus on appropriate statistical methods.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review the statistical methods used in these studies, to identify additional applicable methods, and to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each method for addressing the salient statistical and epidemiological challenges.
METHODS: We searched Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science for epidemiological studies of endocrine-sensitive outcomes in the children of mothers exposed to EDC mixtures during pregnancy and identiﬁed alternative statistical methods from the wider literature. DISCUSSION: We identiﬁed 74 studies and analyzed the methods used to estimate mixture health eﬀects, identify important mixture components, account for nonmonotonicity in exposure–response relationships, assess interactions, and identify windows of exposure susceptibility. We identiﬁed both frequentist and Bayesian methods that are robust to multicollinearity, performing shrinkage, variable selection, dimension reduction, statistical learning, or smoothing, including methods that were not used by the studies included in our review.
CONCLUSIONS: Compelling motivation exists for analyzing EDCs as mixtures, yet many studies make simplifying assumptions about EDC additivity, relative potency, and linearity, or overlook the potential for bias due to asymmetries in chemical persistence. We discuss the potential impacts of these choices and suggest alternative methods to improve analyses of prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2207},

	abstract = {Background Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection leads to malnutrition and anemia, and has been linked to impaired child development. Previous research on this topic is limited and mostly conducted in school-age children. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of the number of detected STH infections between one and two years of age on subsequent cognitive and verbal abilities, in a cohort of preschool children.
Methodology/Principal findings A longitudinal cohort study was conducted in 880 children in Iquitos, Peru between September 2011 and July 2016. Children were recruited at one year of age and followed up at 18 months and then annually between two and five years of age. STH infection was measured with the Kato-Katz technique or the direct smear technique. Child development was measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III at the one to three-year visits and with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III at the four and five-year visits. Hierarchical multivariable linear regression models were used to account for the repeated outcome measures for each child and Bayesian latent class analysis was used to adjust for STH misclassification. Children found infected with any STH infection between one and two years of age had lower cognitive scores between two and five years of age (between group score differences (95\% credible intervals) for infected once, and infected two or three times, compared to never infected: -4.31 (-10.64, -0.14) and -3.70 (-10.11, -0.11), respectively). Similar results were found for Ascaris infection and for verbal scores.
Conclusions/Significance An association was found between having been infected with Ascaris or any STH between one and two years of age and lower cognitive and verbal abilities later in childhood. These},

	abstract = {Background Developmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been implicated as a possible cause of deficient immune function in children. This study was designed to assess whether prenatal and postnatal exposure to PCBs impacts on antibody response to childhood immunizations.
Methods and Findings Two birth cohorts were formed in the Faroe Islands, where exposures vary widely, because traditional diets may include whale blubber contaminated with PCBs. Prenatal exposure was determined from maternal concentrations of PCBs in pregnancy serum and milk. Following routine childhood vaccinations against tetanus and diphtheria, 119 children were examined at 18 mo and 129 children at 7 y of age, and their serum samples were analyzed for tetanus and diphtheria toxoid antibodies and for PCBs. The antibody response to diphtheria toxoid decreased at age 18 mo by 24.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.63–41.9; p ¼ 0.04) for each doubling of the cumulative PCB exposure at the time of examination. The diphtheria response was lower at age 7 y and was not associated with the exposure. However, the tetanus toxoid antibody response was affected mainly at age 7 y, decreasing by 16.5\% (95\% CI, 1.51–29.3; p ¼ 0.03) for each doubling of the prenatal exposure. Structural equation analysis showed that the early postnatal exposure was the most important predictor of a decreased vaccination response.
Conclusions Increased perinatal exposure to PCBs may adversely impact on immune responses to childhood vaccinations. The clinical implications of insufficient antibody production emphasize the need for prevention of immunotoxicant exposures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: When a biologic mechanism of interest is anticipated to operate diﬀerentially according to sex, as is often the case in endocrine disruptors research, investigators routinely estimate sex-speciﬁc associations. Less attention has been given to potential sexual heterogeneity of confounder associations with outcomes. When relationships of covariates with outcomes diﬀer according to sex, commonly applied statistical approaches for estimating sex-speciﬁc endocrine disruptor eﬀects may produce divergent estimates.
OBJECTIVES: We discuss underlying assumptions and evaluate the performance of two traditional approaches for estimating sex-speciﬁc eﬀects, stratiﬁcation and product terms, and introduce a simple modeling alternative: an augmented product term approach.
METHODS: We describe the impact of assumptions regarding sexual heterogeneity of confounder relationships on estimates of sex-speciﬁc eﬀects of the exposure of interest for three approaches: stratiﬁcation, traditional product terms, and augmented product terms. Using simulated and applied examples, we demonstrate properties of each approach under a range of scenarios.
RESULTS: In simulations, sex-speciﬁc exposure eﬀects estimated using the traditional product term approach were biased when confounders had sexdependent associations with the outcome. Sex-speciﬁc estimates from stratiﬁcation and the augmented product term approach were unbiased but less precise. In the applied example, the three approaches yielded similar estimates, but resulted in some meaningful diﬀerences in conclusions based on statistical signiﬁcance.
CONCLUSIONS: Investigators should consider sexual heterogeneity of confounder associations when choosing an analytic approach to estimate sexspeciﬁc eﬀects of endocrine disruptors on health. In the presence of sex-dependent confounding, our augmented product term approach may be advantageous over stratiﬁcation when there is prior knowledge available to ﬁt reduced models or when investigators seek an automated test for eﬀect measure modiﬁcation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP334},

Many phenols are still authorized in personal care products (PCP). We aimed to assess if use of PCPs, by pregnant women could inﬂuence their urinary concentrations of synthetic phenols.
Methods: We used a panel design with intense urine sample collection. Eight women completed a diary with exact time and use of PCPs in three weeks. We measured the concentrations of phenols (four parabens, bisphenol A and S, two dichlorophenols, triclosan, and benzophenone-3) in 178 urine samples, collected during 7 consecutive days at 3 time points during pregnancy. We characterized PCP use as the total number of PCP applications or as a single PCP use (yes/no) in three time windows (0–6, 6 to 12 and 12 to 24h before each urine sample collection). We used adjusted linear and Tobit regressions to assess associations between PCP use and phenol urinary concentrations.
Results: The total number of PCP applications was positively associated with ethylparaben, propylparaben and butylparaben concentrations. We observed a peak in urinary concentration of ethylparaben, butylparaben and propylparaben at 2.86, 2.55 and 2.67 h since last PCP use, respectively and twelve diﬀerent types of PCPs were positively associated with at least one of these parabens. The bisphenol S concentration increased by 12.4\% (95\%CI: conﬁdence interval: 5.9; 19.3) for each additional PCP application in the 12 to 24 time window and use of speciﬁc PCPs such as anti-stretchmarks cream, facial cleanser and shower gel. Associations varied by time window.
Conclusion: Our study showed that PCP use was associated with a short-term increase in the urinary concentration of ethylparaben, butylparaben and propylparaben, but not methylparaben. This study also reported a},

	abstract = {Background: Parabens, bisphenol A and triclosan have been forbidden or restricted in specific types of consumer goods in Europe and France. Limited biomonitoring data are available in France since the implementation of these regulations, and exposure data on infants is scarce worldwide. Understanding the predictors of phenol urinary concentrations will help identify potential targets for prevention. Aim: We described levels, variability and predictors of exposure to 12 phenols in pregnant women and infants recruited between 2014 and 2017 in a French couple-child cohort.
Methods: Among 479 pregnant women and 150 of their infants, we studied phenol urinary concentrations in within-subject, within-period pools of repeated urine samples collected during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (up to 42 samples per woman), at 2 months and 12 months (up to 14 samples per infant). Time trends and associations with demographic, protocol, occupational and behavioral factors were studied using interval censored models to accommodate for undetected and unquantified urine concentrations.
Results: Detection rates were above 90\% for bisphenol A, ethylparaben, methylparaben, benzophenone-3 and triclosan and below 5\% for bisphenol AF, B, F and triclocarban. Median levels of bisphenol A, bisphenol S, methylparaben, ethylparaben and propylparaben at 12 months were similar or higher than during pregnancy. For pregnant women all phenols but benzophenone-3 and bisphenol S showed a linear decrease between 2014 and 2017 (p-values {\textless} 0.02). Women with the shortest education (primary and secondary school) had higher urinary concentrations of triclosan (β = 0.58 (95\% confidence interval (CI), −0.04; 1.20)), ethyl (β = 0.43 (95\%CI, 0.03; 0.84)) and propyl paraben (β = 1.39 (95\%CI, 0.55; 2.24)) than those with the longest education. Cashiers had higher conccentrations of bisphenol S (β = 0.99 (95\%CI, −0.11; 2.09)) but not of bisphenol A (β = −0.04 (95\%CI, −0.26; 0.19)) than unemployed women.
Conclusions: Despite recent regulations, bisphenol A, triclosan and paraben detection rates were high in women and young infants. High bisphenol and paraben median levels at 12 months require further investigation as early infancy is a sensitive period for exposure to environmental contaminants.},

	abstract = {Background: Estimating the health effects of multi-pollutant mixtures is of increasing interest in environmental epidemiology. Recently, a new approach for estimating the health effects of mixtures, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), has been developed. This method estimates the multivariable exposure-response function in a flexible and parsimonious way, conducts variable selection on the (potentially high-dimensional) vector of exposures, and allows for a grouped variable selection approach that can accommodate highly correlated exposures. However, the application of this novel method has been limited by a lack of available software, the need to derive interpretable output in a computationally efficient manner, and the inability to apply the method to non-continuous outcome variables.
Methods: This paper addresses these limitations by (i) introducing an open-source software package in the R programming language, the bkmr R package, (ii) demonstrating methods for visualizing high-dimensional exposure-response functions, and for estimating scientifically relevant summaries, (iii) illustrating a probit regression implementation of BKMR for binary outcomes, and (iv) describing a fast version of BKMR that utilizes a Gaussian predictive process approach. All of the methods are illustrated using fully reproducible examples with the provided R code.
Results: Applying the methods to a continuous outcome example illustrated the ability of the BKMR implementation to estimate the health effects of multi-pollutant mixtures in the context of a highly nonlinear, biologically-based doseresponse function, and to estimate overall, single-exposure, and interactive health effects. The Gaussian predictive process method led to a substantial reduction in the runtime, without a major decrease in accuracy. In the setting of a larger number of exposures and a dichotomous outcome, the probit BKMR implementation was able to correctly identify the variables included in the exposure-response function and yielded interpretable quantities on the scale of a latent continuous outcome or on the scale of the outcome probability.
Conclusions: This newly developed software, integrated suite of tools, and extended methodology makes BKMR accessible for use across a broad range of epidemiological applications in which multiple risk factors have complex effects on health.},

	abstract = {Background: Days of extreme temperature may be associated with transiently higher risk of preterm birth, but prior studies have been limited and results have been heterogeneous.
Objectives: To evaluate the association between days of extreme heat and cold and risk of preterm birth among {\textasciitilde}32 million live singleton births between 1989 and 2002 across 403 counties in the contiguous United States (US).
Methods: We used a distributed lag nonlinear model to estimate the association between population-weighted daily mean temperature and risk of preterm birth in each county and then pooled results across geographic regions and climate zones. We deﬁned extreme heat and cold as the 95th and 5th percentile of the countyspeciﬁc temperatures, respectively.
Results: Preterm birth accounted for 9.3\% of deliveries. There was a monotonic association between ambient temperature and risk of preterm birth. Days of extreme heat and cold were associated with a relative risk of preterm birth of 1.025 (95\% CI: 1.015, 1.036) and 0.985 (95\% CI: 0.976, 0.993) over the subsequent four days, respectively, relative to the county-speciﬁc median temperature. If causal, the fraction of preterm births attributable to extreme heat was 0.17\% (empirical 95\% CI: 0.14\%, 0.19\%), corresponding to 154 (empirical 95\% CI: 127, 173) preterm births per million births. Extreme heat was more strongly associated with preterm birth in regions with colder and drier climates, and among younger women. Days of extreme cold temperature were associated with lower rather than higher risk of preterm birth.
Conclusions: Days of extreme heat, but not extreme cold, are associated with higher risk of preterm birth in the contiguous US. If causal, these results may have important implications for the management of pregnant women during forecasted periods of extreme heat.},

	abstract = {Epidemiologic analyses of the health effects of meteorological exposures typically rely on observations from the nearest weather station to assess exposure for geographically diverse populations. Gridded climate datasets (GCD) provide spatially resolved weather data that may offer improved exposure estimates, but have not been systematically validated for use in epidemiologic evaluations. As a validation, we linearly regressed daily weather estimates from two GCDs, PRISM and Daymet, to observations from a sample of weather stations across the conterminous United States and compared spatially resolved, population-weighted county average temperatures and heat indices from PRISM to single-pixel PRISM values at the weather stations to identify differences. We found that both Daymet and PRISM accurately estimate ambient temperature and mean heat index at sampled weather stations, but PRISM outperforms Daymet for assessments of humidity and maximum daily heat index. Moreover, spatially-resolved exposure estimates differ from point-based assessments, but with substantial inter-county heterogeneity. We conclude that GCDs offer a potentially useful approach to exposure assessment of meteorological variables that may, in some locations, reduce exposure measurement error, as well as permit assessment of populations distributed far from weather stations.},

	title = {Preterm birth and heat waves: {Influence} of the spatial resolution of the exposure estimate in determining the association},
	abstract = {Background Previous research evaluating the association between heat waves and adverse birth outcomes has primarily rlied on ambient temperature data from weather stations to define heat waves. However, varying spatial resolutions of ambient temperature may lead to exposure misclassification and bias in the relationship between heat waves and health outcomes, particularly across urban and rural landscapes. This study examined the association between heat waves and preterm birth (PTB) by using ZIP code level, 12.5 km2 grid, and 1 km2 grid ambient temperature datasets derived from satellites and ground-level weather stations.
Method We implemented a time-stratified case-crossover design to test the association between heat waves and PTB by using geocoded maternal addresses on birth records in Alabama, USA during May-September from 1990 to 2010. The North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) was used to calculate ZIP code- and 12.5 km2 grid heat wave indexes (HIs), respectively. Moreover, NLDAS data was downscaled by using land surface temperatures (LST) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product (MOD11A2) to estimate air temperature within 1 km2 grids.
Results A significant positive association between heat waves and PTB was found in all models, using ZIP code-, 12.5 km2 grid, and 1 km2 grid level exposure metrics. Furthermore, similar effect estimates were produced by these three exposure metrics. When models are stratified by rurality, stronger positive associations between heat waves and PTB are seen in urban areas, even when using 1 km2 grid HIs that capture urban heat islands.
Conclusions Increasing spatial resolution does not change positive association estimates between preterm birth and extreme heat events in the present analysis. Our results indicate urban communities may be at greater risk, potentially due to the urban heat island effect, although further analyses comparing other urban and rural areas is needed to determine the generalizability of this result.},

	abstract = {Background: With the gradual increase of global warming, the impact of extreme temperatures on health has become a focus of attention, however, its relationship with preterm birth remains unclear.
Objectives: To investigate the association between exposure to extreme temperatures and preterm birth.
Methods: Temperature exposures and birth outcomes of 1,020,471 pregnant women from 132 cities in China were investigated. The pregnancy process was divided into different pregnancy periods. Study areas were divided into three categories (cold, medium, and hot areas) according to the local average temperature by cluster analysis. Average temperature data for each province used in the cluster analysis came from the China Statistical Yearbook 2013. Logistic regression was used to compare the effects of exposure to hot and cold conditions on the outcomes of pregnancy in different periods and regions.
Results: A total of 1,020,471 singleton births were included, of which 73,240(7.2\%) were preterm births. Compared with moderate temperatures (5th to 95th percentile), heat exposure (N 95th percentile) in different periods of pregnancy increased the risk of preterm birth in hot areas. The most obvious increase was during the 3 months before pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) = 1.229, 95\% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.166–1.295). In contrast to heat exposure, cold exposure (b 5th percentile) in hot areas reduced the risk of preterm birth; the protective effect was most pronounced in the 3 months before pregnancy (OR = 0.784, 95\% CI: 0.734–0.832). In medium and cold areas cold exposure also reduced the risk of preterm birth. The effect of exposure to extreme ambient temperatures throughout the entire pregnancy on preterm birth was similar to those of the periods above.
Conclusions: Acute and chronic exposure to extreme temperatures may affect the risk of preterm birth. Extreme heat is a risk factor for preterm birth and extreme cold is a protective factor. © 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality. Identifying potentially modiﬁable triggers toward the end of gestation, such as extreme heat, can improve understanding of the role of acute stress on early deliveries and inform warning systems. In this study we examined the association between extreme heat, variously deﬁned during the last week of gestation, and risk of preterm birth among mothers in California.
Methods: We created a population-based cohort comprised of 1,967,300 mothers who had live, singleton births in California, from May through September 2005–2013. Daily temperature data estimated at the maternal zip code of residence was used to create 12 deﬁnitions of extreme heat with varying relative temperatures (75th, 90th, 95th, and 98th percentiles) and durations (at least 2, 3, or 4 consecutive days). We estimated risk of preterm birth ({\textless} 37 gestational weeks) in relation to exposure to extreme heat during the last week of gestation with multi-level Cox proportional hazard regression models, adjusting for maternal characteristics, sex of neonate, and seasonality. We also included randomly generated data, SAS code, and estimates for reproducibility purposes.
Results: Approximately 7\% of the cohort had a preterm birth. For all deﬁnitions of extreme heat, the risk of preterm birth was consistently higher among mothers who experienced an extreme heat episode during their last week of gestation. Hazard ratios ranged from 1.008 (95\% CI: 0.997, 1.021) to 1.128 (95\% CI: 1.052, 1.210), with increasing associations as the relative temperature and duration of extreme heat episode increased.
Conclusion: This study adds to the previous literature by considering multiple deﬁnitions of extreme heat and applying a time-to-event framework. Findings suggest that acute exposure to extreme heat during the last week of gestation may trigger an earlier delivery. Implementing heat warning systems targeted toward pregnant women may improve birth outcomes.},

Methods: Data of daily singleton PTB, air pollution and meteorological variables from 2005 to 2011 were collected in Shenzhen. A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used to investigate the association of the low and high temperatures (1st, 5th, 95th, and 99th percentiles) with PTB.
Results: The median temperature was 24.5 °C and the 1st, 5th, 95th, and 99th percentiles of daily mean temperatures were 9, 12.5, 29.9 and 30.7 °C, respectively. The prevalence of singleton PTB was 5.61 \% in Shenzhen. The association between temperature and PTB was not linear. There was an immediate positive association of low temperature (1st and 5th percentiles) and a negative association of high temperature (95th and 99th percentiles) with PTB. The effect of low temperature 9 °C (1st) on PTB on the current day was stronger than that of 12.5 °C (5th), with a relative risk (RR) of 1.54 (95 \% CI: 1.36–1.75) and 1.49 (95 \% CI: 1.35–1.63), respectively. The cumulative RR (up to 30 days) of 9 and 12.5 °C was 1.72 (95 \% CI: 1.28–2.33) and 1.96 (95 \% CI: 1.60–2.39), respectively. The cumulative effects (up to 30 days) of high temperature (95th and 99th percentiles) on PTB were 0.69 (95 \% CI: 0.60–0.80) and 0.62 (95 \% CI: 0.52–0.74), respectively. The cumulative effect (up to 30 days) of low temperatures on vaginal delivery PTB was lower than that of the cesarean section PTB with an RR of 1.58 (95 \% CI: 1.12–2.22) and 1.93 (95 \% CI: 1.21–3.08), respectively.

	abstract = {Recent evidence from studies performed mainly in warm climates suggests an association between exposure to extreme temperatures late in pregnancy and an increased risk of preterm delivery. However, there have been fewer studies on the effect of low temperatures. The aim of this study is to explore the potential association between both heat and cold during late pregnancy and an increased risk of preterm birth in the northern location of Stockholm, Sweden. All singleton spontaneous births that took place in greater Stockholm (1998–2006) were included. Non-linear and delayed effects of mean temperature on the risk of preterm birth were explored through distributed lag non-linear models. Extreme and moderate heat and cold were estimated separately through quasi-Poisson regression analysis in two seasonal periods (heat in warm season, cold in cold season). The risk of preterm birth increased by 4\%–5\% when the mean temperature reached the 75th percentile (moderate heat) four weeks earlier (reference: the annual median value), with a maximum cumulative risk ratio of 2.50 (95\% confidence interval: 1.02–6.15). Inconsistent associations were obtained for cold and extreme heat. Exposure to moderately high temperatures during late pregnancy might be associated with an increase in risk of preterm birth in Stockholm.},

	abstract = {Background: Recent studies have reported inconsistent associations between maternal residential green space and preterm birth (PTB, born {\textless} 37 completed gestational weeks). In addition, windows of susceptibility during pregnancy have not been explored and potential interactions of green space with air pollution exposures during pregnancy are still unclear.
Objectives: To evaluate the relationships between green space and PTB, identify windows of susceptibility, and explore potential interactions between green space and air pollution.
Methods: Birth certificate records for all births in California (2001–2008) were obtained. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to characterized green space exposure. Gestational age was treated as a time-to-event outcome; Cox proportional hazard models were applied to estimate the association between green space exposure and PTB, moderately PTB (MPTB, gestational age {\textless} 35 weeks), and very PTB (VPTB, gestational age {\textless} 30 weeks), after controlling for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, and median household income. Month-specific green space exposure was used to identify potential windows of susceptibility. Potential interactions between green space and air pollution [fine particulate matter {\textless} 2.5 µm (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3)] were examined on both additive and multiplicative scales.
Results: In total, 3,753,799 eligible births were identified, including 341,123 (9.09\%) PTBs, 124,631 (3.32\%) MPTBs, and 22,313 (0.59\%) VPTBs. A reduced risk of PTB was associated with increases in residential NDVI exposure in 250 m, 500 m, 1000 m, and 2000 m buffers. In the 2000 m buffer, the association was strongest for VPTB [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) per interquartile range increase in NDVI: 0.959, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.942–0.976)], followed by MPTB (HR = 0.970, 95\% CI: 0.962–0.978) and overall PTB (HR = 0.972, 95\% CI: 0.966–0.978). For PTB, green space during the 3rd − 5th gestational months had stronger associations than those in the other time periods, especially during the 4th gestational month (NDVI 2000 m: HR = 0.970, 95\% CI: 0.965–0.975). We identified consistent positive additive and multiplicative interactions between decreasing green space and higher air pollution.
Conclusion: This large study found that maternal exposure to residential green space was associated with decreased risk of PTB, MPTB, and VPTB, especially in the second trimester. There is a synergistic effect between low green space and high air pollution levels on PTB, indicating that increasing exposure to green space may be more beneficial for women with higher air pollution exposures during pregnancy.},

	abstract = {Background: Measures of attributable risk are an integral part of epidemiological analyses, particularly when aimed at the planning and evaluation of public health interventions. However, the current definition of such measures does not consider any temporal relationships between exposure and risk. In this contribution, we propose extended definitions of attributable risk within the framework of distributed lag non-linear models, an approach recently proposed for modelling delayed associations in either linear or non-linear exposure-response associations.
Methods: We classify versions of attributable number and fraction expressed using either a forward or backward perspective. The former specifies the future burden due to a given exposure event, while the latter summarizes the current burden due to the set of exposure events experienced in the past. In addition, we illustrate how the components related to sub-ranges of the exposure can be separated.
Results: We apply these methods for estimating the mortality risk attributable to outdoor temperature in two cities, London and Rome, using time series data for the periods 1993–2006 and 1992–2010, respectively. The analysis provides estimates of the overall mortality burden attributable to temperature, and then computes the components attributable to cold and heat and then mild and extreme temperatures.
Conclusions: These extended definitions of attributable risk account for the additional temporal dimension which characterizes exposure-response associations, providing more appropriate attributable measures in the presence of dependencies characterized by potentially complex temporal patterns.},

This extension oﬀers built-in model selection procedures and the possibility of accommodating assumptions on the shape of the lag structure through speciﬁc penalties. In addition, this framework includes, as special cases, simpler models previously proposed for linear relationships (DLMs). Alternative versions of penalized DLNMs are compared with each other and with the standard unpenalized version in a simulation study. Results show that this penalized extension to the DLNM class provides greater ﬂexibility and improved inferential properties. The framework exploits recent theoretical developments of GAMs and is implemented using eﬃcient routines within freely available software. Real-data applications are illustrated through two reproducible examples in time series and survival analysis.},

	title = {Reducing and meta-analysing estimates from distributed lag non-linear models},
	abstract = {Background: The two-stage time series design represents a powerful analytical tool in environmental epidemiology. Recently, models for both stages have been extended with the development of distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs), a methodology for investigating simultaneously non-linear and lagged relationships, and multivariate meta-analysis, a methodology to pool estimates of multi-parameter associations. However, the application of both methods in two-stage analyses is prevented by the high-dimensional deﬁnition of DLNMs. Methods: In this contribution we propose a method to synthesize DLNMs to simpler summaries, expressed by a reduced set of parameters of one-dimensional functions, which are compatible with current multivariate meta-analytical techniques. The methodology and modelling framework are implemented in R through the packages dlnm and mvmeta. Results: As an illustrative application, the method is adopted for the two-stage time series analysis of temperature-mortality associations using data from 10 regions in England and Wales. R code and data are available as supplementary online material. Discussion and Conclusions: The methodology proposed here extends the use of DLNMs in two-stage analyses, obtaining meta-analytical estimates of easily interpretable summaries from complex non-linear and delayed associations. The approach relaxes the assumptions and avoids simpliﬁcations required by simpler modelling approaches.},

	abstract = {In humans, studies based on Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) concept and targeting short half-lived chemicals, including many endocrine disruptors, generally assessed exposures from spot biospecimens. Effects of early-life exposure to atmospheric pollutants were reported, based on outdoor air pollution levels. For both exposure families, exposure misclassification is expected from these designs: for non-persistent chemicals, because a spot biospecimen is unlikely to capture exposure over windows longer than a few days; for air pollutants, because indoor levels are ignored. We developed a couple-child cohort relying on deep phenotyping and extended personal exposure assessment aiming to better characterize the effects of components of the exposome, including air pollutants and non-persistent endocrine disruptors, on child health and development. Pregnant women were included in SEPAGES couple-child cohort (Grenoble area) from 2014 to 2017. Maternal and children exposure to air pollutants was repeatedly assessed by personal monitors. DNA, RNA, serum, plasma, placenta, cord blood, meconium, child and mother stools, living cells, milk, hair and repeated urine samples were collected. A total of 484 pregnant women were recruited, with excellent compliance to the repeated urine sampling protocol (median, 43 urine samples per woman during pregnancy). The main health outcomes are child respiratory health using early objective measures, growth and neurodevelopment. Compared to former studies, the accuracy of assessment of non-persistent exposures is expected to be strongly improved in this new type of birth cohort tailored for the exposome concept, with deep phenotyping and extended exposure characterization. By targeting weaknesses in exposure assessment of the current approaches of cohorts on effects of early life environmental exposures with strong temporal variations, and relying on a rich biobank to provide insight on the underlying biological pathways whereby exposures affect health, this design is expected to provide deeper understanding of the interplay between the Exposome and child development and health.},

	abstract = {Understanding and managing the health eﬀects of ambient temperature (Ta) in a warming, urbanizing world requires spatially- and temporally-resolved Ta at high resolutions. This is challenging in a large area like France which includes highly variable topography, rural areas with few weather stations, and heterogeneous urban areas where Ta can vary at ﬁne spatial scales. We have modeled daily Ta from 2000 to 2016 at a base resolution of 1 km2 across continental France and at a 200 × 200 m2 resolution over large urban areas. For each day we predict three Ta measures: minimum (Tmin), mean (Tmean), and maximum (Tmax). We start by using linear mixed models to calibrate daily Ta observations from weather stations with remotely sensed MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and other spatial predictors (e.g. NDVI, elevation) on a 1 km2 grid. We ﬁll gaps where LST is missing (e.g. due to cloud cover) with additional mixed models that capture the relationship between predicted Ta at each location and observed Ta at nearby weather stations. The resulting 1 km Ta models perform very well, with ten-fold cross-validated R2 of 0.92, 0.97, and 0.95, mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.4 °C, 0.9 °C, and 1.4 °C, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.9 °C, 1.3 °C, and 1.8 °C (Tmin, Tmean, and Tmax, respectively) for the initial calibration stage. To increase the spatial resolution over large urban areas, we train random forest and extreme gradient boosting models to predict the residuals (R) of the 1 km Ta predictions on a 200 × 200 m2 grid. In this stage we replace MODIS LST and NDVI with composited top-of-atmosphere brightness temperature and NDVI from the Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellites. We use a generalized additive model to ensemble the random forest and extreme gradient boosting predictions with weights that vary spatially and by the magnitude of the predicted residual. The 200 m models also perform well, with ten-fold cross-validated R2 of 0.79, 0.79, and 0.85, MAE of 0.4, 0.3, and 0.3, and RMSE of 0.6, 0.4, and 0.5 (Rmin, Rmean, and Rmax, respectively). Our model will reduce bias in epidemiological studies in France by improving Ta exposure assessment in both urban and rural areas, and our methodology demonstrates that MODIS and Landsat thermal data can be used to generate gap-free timeseries of daily minimum, maximum, and mean Ta at a 200 × 200 m2 spatial resolution.},

	abstract = {Background: Pesticide use is widespread in agriculture. Several studies have shown that pesticides used in agricultural fields can contaminate the domestic environment and thus be an important source of pesticide exposure of populations residing nearby. Epidemiological studies that have examined the health effects of in utero pesticide exposure from residence near agricultural activities suggest adverse effects, but the results are inconsistent. Our purpose was to investigate the effect on intrauterine growth of such exposure due to agricultural activities in the residential municipality.
Methods: A prospective birth cohort recruited 3421 pregnant women in a French agricultural region (Brittany, 2002-2006) through gynecologists, ultrasonographers, and maternity hospitals during routine prenatal care visits before 19 weeks of gestation. The national agricultural census in 2000 provided the percentages of the municipality area devoted to cultivation of corn, wheat, colza, peas, potatoes, and fresh vegetables.
Results: Birth weight and the risk of fetal growth restriction were not associated with agricultural activities in the municipality of residence in early pregnancy. Children whose mother lived in a municipality where peas were grown had a smaller head circumference at birth than those in municipalities not growing peas (-0.2 cm, p = 0.0002). Head circumference also tended to be lower when wheat was grown, but not to a statistically significant degree (p-trend = 0.10). Risk of an infant with a small head circumference was higher for mothers living in a municipality where peas (OR = 2.2; 95\% CI = 1.2-3.6) or potatoes (OR = 1.5; 95\% CI = 0.9-2.4) were grown.
Conclusions: Agricultural activities in the municipality of residence may have negative effects on cranial growth. Cultivation of pea crops and, to a lesser degree, potato and wheat crops, may negatively affect head circumference. Insecticides, including organophosphate insecticides, were applied to most of the area devoted to pea and potato crops; this was less true for corn and wheat crops. These results must be interpreted in light of the study’s limitations, in particular, the scale at which we could assess pesticide exposure.},

	abstract = {Previous studies suggest that green and blue spaces may promote several health outcomes including birth outcomes. However, no synthesis of previous work has speciﬁcally asked policy-relevant questions of how much and what type is needed in every neighborhood to elicit these beneﬁts at the population level. A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted to synthesize thirty-seven studies on the association between residential green and blue spaces and pregnancy outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed for birth weight (BW), small for gestational age (SGA), low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB). Increase in residential greenness was statistically signiﬁcantly associated with higher BW [β = 0.001, 95\%CI: ({\textless}0.001, 0.002)] and lower odds of SGA [OR = 0.95, 95\%CI: (0.92, 0.97)]. Associations between green space and LBW and PTB were as hypothesized but not statistically signiﬁcant. Associations between blue spaces and pregnancy outcomes were not evident. No study explicitly examined questions of threshold, though some evidence of nonlinearity indicated that moderate amounts of green space may support more favorable pregnancy outcomes. Policy-relevant green and blue space exposures involving theory-driven thresholds warrant testing to ensure future investments in urban greening promote healthier pregnancy outcomes.},

We add to this body of literature by exploring the relationship between expectant mothers’ exposure to green and blue spaces and adverse birth outcomes in New York City. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the NYC Street Tree Census, and access to major green spaces served as measures of greenness, while proximity to waterfront areas represented access to blue space. Associations between these factors and adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth, term birthweight, term low birthweight, and small for gestational age, were evaluated via mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models. The analyses were conducted separately for women living in deprived neighborhoods to test for differential effects on mothers in these areas. The results indicate that women in deprived neighborhoods suffer from higher rates adverse birth outcomes and lower levels of residential greenness. In adjusted models, a signiﬁcant inverse association between nearby street trees and the odds of preterm birth was found for all women. However, we did not identify a consistent signiﬁcant relationship between adverse birth outcomes and NDVI, access to major green spaces, or waterfront access when individual covariates were taken into account.},

We analyzed a cohort of newborns in Rome, from April to October of 2001–2013, deﬁning preterm as births between the 22nd and the 36th week of gestation. We used a time series approach, with maximum apparent temperature (MAT), PM10, NO2, and O3 as exposure variables. As greenness indicators, we considered maternal residential proximity to green spaces and the Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI) within a 100 m buﬀer around each woman’s residential address. We enrolled 56,576 newborns (5.1\% preterm). The eﬀect of a 1 ◦C increase in temperature on the daily number of preterm births was higher in women with low SEP (+2.49\% (90\% CI: 1.29–3.71)) and among those living within 100 m from green spaces (+3.33\% (90\% CI: 1.82–4.87)). No eﬀect modiﬁcation was observed for NDVI or PM10. SEP was an important eﬀect modiﬁer of the heat-preterm birth relationship. The role of greenness in modifying this association between heat and preterm delivery should be further investigated.},

Methods This study covers antenatal data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register on 192,432 women (aged 26.0 years on average) born at term, from singleton pregnancies, and of Nordic ethnicity. Continuous associations between women's heights and the likelihood of preterm birth in the offspring were evaluated. Stratified analyses were also carried out, separating women into different height categories.
Results Every cm decrease in maternal stature was associated with 0.2 days shortening of gestational age in the offspring (p{\textless}0.0001) and increasing odds of having a child born preterm (OR 1.03), very preterm (OR 1.03), or extremely preterm (OR 1.04). Besides, odds of all categories of preterm birth were highest among the shortest women but lowest among the tallest mothers. Specifically, women of short stature ( 155 cm or  -2.0 SDS below the population mean) had greater odds of having preterm (OR 1.65) or very preterm (OR 1.47) infants than women of average stature (-0.5 to 0.5 SDS). When compared to women of tall stature ( 179 cm), mothers of short stature had even greater odds of giving birth to preterm (OR 2.07) or very preterm (OR 2.16) infants.
Conclusions Among Swedish women, decreasing height was associated with a progressive increase in the odds of having an infant born preterm. Maternal short stature is a likely contributing factor to idiopathic preterm births worldwide, possibly due to maternal anatomical constraints.},

We examined the association between PTB and ambient temperature during diﬀerent timing windows of pregnancy: conception month, three trimesters, birth month and entire pregnancy. We found a U-shaped relation between the prevalence of PTB and mean ambient temperature during pregnancy. Both high and low temperatures were associated with PTB risk, adjusted OR (95\% CI) respectively 2.57 (1.98–3.33) and 2.39 (1.93–2.95) for 0.5 °C increase in high temperature range ({\textgreater} 18.2°C) and 0.5°C decrease in low temperature range ({\textless} 18.2°C). Speciﬁcally, PTB was signiﬁcantly associated with ambient temperature and extreme heat/cold days during conception month and the third trimester. Sensitivity analysis indicated that female fetus were more susceptible to the risk of ambient temperature. Our study indicates that the risk of preterm birth due to high or low temperature may exist early during the conception month.},

Population and method. – All live births during one week in 1995 (n = 13,318), 2003 (n = 14,737), 2010 (n = 14,903) and 2016 (n = 13,384). Data were from interviews of women in postpartum wards and from medical records and were compared between years.
Results. – Between 1995 and 2016, maternal age and body mass index increased steadily. Pregnancies that occurred with use of contraception increased from 7.4\% in 2010 to 9.3\% in 2016. Smoking during pregnancy (16.6\%) did not decrease since 2010. The frequency of more than three ultrasounds during pregnancy was 48.5\% in 1995 and 74.7\% in 2016. Deliveries in large public hospitals increased steadily. The caesarean section rate has been relatively stable since 2003 (20.4\% in 2003, 21.1\% in 2010 and 20.4\% in 2016). The rate of induction of labour was 22\% in 2010 and 2016. Overall, 83.8\% of women had epidural analgesia/anaesthesia in 2016. Rates of pre-term birth in 2016 ranged from 7.5\% among all live births to 6.0\% among live born singletons; for singletons, this rate increased steadily from 1995 to 2016, whereas there was no clear trend for low birth weight. Exclusive breastfeeding decreased from 60.3\% in 2010 to 52.2\% in 2016.
Conclusion. – Routine national perinatal surveys highlight successful policies and recommendations but also point out some health indicators, practices, preventive behaviours and risk factors that need special attention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both extreme heat and air pollution exposure during pregnancy have been associated with preterm birth; however, their combined eﬀects are unclear.
OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to estimate the independent and joint eﬀects of heatwaves and ﬁne particulate matter [PM {\textless}2:5 lm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2:5)], exposure during the ﬁnal gestational week on preterm birth.
METHODS: Using birth registry data from Guangzhou, China, we included 215,059 singleton live births in the warm season (1 May–31 October) between January 2015 and July 2017. Daily meteorological variables from 5 monitoring stations and PM2:5 concentrations from 11 sites were used to estimate district-speciﬁc exposures. A series of cut oﬀ temperature thresholds and durations (2, 3, and 4 consecutive d) were used to deﬁne 15 diﬀerent heatwaves. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the eﬀects of heatwaves and PM2:5 exposures during the ﬁnal week on preterm birth, and departures from additive joint eﬀects were assessed using the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI).
RESULTS: Numbers of preterm births increased in association with heatwave exposures during the ﬁnal gestational week. Depending on the heatwave deﬁnition used, hazard ratios (HRs) ranged from 1.10 (95\% CI: 1.01, 1.20) to 1.92 (1.39, 2.64). Associations were stronger for more intense heatwaves. Combined eﬀects of PM2:5 exposures and heatwaves appeared to be synergistic (RERIs {\textgreater}0) for less extreme heatwaves (i.e., shorter or with relatively low temperature thresholds) but were less than additive (RERIs {\textless}0) for more intense heatwaves.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research strengthens the evidence that exposure to heatwaves during the ﬁnal gestational week can independently trigger preterm birth. Moderate heatwaves may also act synergistically with PM2:5 exposure to increase risk of preterm birth, which adds new evidence to the current understanding of combined eﬀects of air pollution and meteorological variables on adverse birth outcomes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5117},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ecologic studies are commonly used to report associations between short-term air pollution and mortality. In such studies, the unit of observation is the day rather than the individual. Moreover, individual data on the subjects are rarely available, which limits the assessment of individual risk factors. These associations can also be investigated using case–crossover studies. However, by deﬁnition, individual risk factors are not studied, and such studies analyze only dead subjects, which limits the statistical power.
OBJECTIVE: We suggest that the survival analysis is more suitable when cohorts are examined with a time-dependent ecologic exposure. To our knowledge, to date this type of analysis has never been proposed. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, MEASUREMENTS: In the present study we used a Cox proportional hazards model to investigate the distribution over time of the short-term effect of black smoke and sulfur dioxide in 439 nonaccidental and 158 cardiorespiratory deaths among the 1,469 subjects of the Personnes Agées QUID (PAQUID) cohort in Bordeaux, France. The model has a delayed entry and a polynomial distributed lag from 0 to 5 days. Results are adjusted for individual risk factors, temperature, relative humidity, weekday, season, inﬂuenza epidemics, and a time function to control temporal trends.
RESULTS: We identiﬁed a positive and signiﬁcant association between cardiorespiratory mortality and black smoke, with a 24\% increase in deaths 3 days after a 10-µg/m3 increase in black smoke (95\% conﬁdence interval, 4–47\%).
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the Cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates is very suitable to investigate simultaneously the short-term effect of air pollution on health and the effect of individual risk factors on a cohort study.},

	abstract = {Background: There is concern that the rate of planned births (by pre-labour caesarean section or induction of labour) is increasing and that the gestation at which they are being conducted is decreasing. The aim of this study was to describe trends in the distribution of gestational age, and assess the contribution of planned birth to any such changes.
Methods: We utilised the New South Wales (NSW) Perinatal Data Collection to undertake a population-based study of all births in NSW, Australia 1994–2009. Trends in gestational age were determined by year, labour onset and plurality of birth.
Results: From 1994–2009, there was a gradual and steady left-shift in overall distribution of gestational age at birth, with a decline in the modal gestational age from 40 to 39 weeks. For singletons, there was a steady but significant reduction in the proportion of spontaneous births. Labour inductions increased in the proportion performed, with a gradual and changing shift in the distribution from a majority at 40 weeks to an increase at both 37–39 weeks and 41 weeks gestation. The proportion of pre-labour caesareans also increased steadily at each gestational age and doubled since 1994, with most performed at 39 weeks in 2009 compared with 38 weeks up to 2001.
Conclusions: Findings suggest a changing pattern towards births at earlier gestations, fewer births commencing spontaneously and increasing planned births. Factors associated with changing clinical practice and long-term implications on the health and well-being of mothers and babies should be assessed.},

This article examines the changing epidemiology of gestational length among singleton births in the United States, from 1992 to 2002. Analyzing gestational age by mode of delivery, the distribution of spontaneous births shifted to the left, with 39 weeks becoming the most common length of gestation in 2002, compared with 40 weeks in 1992 (P {\textless} 0.001). Deliveries at {\textgreater}40 weeks gestation markedly decreased, accompanied by an increase in those at 34 to 39 weeks (P {\textless} 0.001). Singleton births with PROM or medical interventions had similar trends. Changes in the distribution of all singleton births differed by race/ethnicity, with non-Hispanic white infants having the largest increase in late preterm births. These observations, in addition to emerging evidence of increased morbidity, suggest the need for investigation of optimal obstetric and neonatal management of these late preterm infants.

Setting Tertiary university-afﬁliated medical centre. Patients All newborns of low-risk singleton pregnancies born at 39+0 to 44+0 weeks’ gestation over a 5-year period. Exclusion criteria: multiple gestation, maternal hypertensive disorder, diabetes or cholestasis, placental abruption or intrapartum fever ({\textgreater}38°C), small for gestational age ({\textless}10th centile) and major congenital or chromosomal anomalies. Interventions None. Outcome measures Admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), hospital length of stay, 5-min Apgar score, birth trauma, respiratory, neurological, metabolic and infectious morbidities and neonatal mortality. The adverse outcome rate was compared among three groups based on gestational age at birth: post-term (≥42+0 weeks), late term (41+0 to 41 +6 weeks) and full term (39+0 to 40+6 weeks).
Results Of the 23 524 eligible neonates, 747 (3.2\%) were born post-term, 4632 (19.7\%) late term and 18 145 (77.1\%) full term. Women in the post-term group versus the late-term group had a signiﬁcantly higher rate of caesarean section (8.9\% vs 5.6\%, p{\textless}0.001) and operative vaginal delivery (9.6\% vs 7.4\%, p=0.024). Post-term pregnancy versus full-term pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of NICU admission (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.4 to 2.8), respiratory morbidity (OR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.3 to 3.8) and infectious morbidity (OR 1.88, 95\% CI 1.32 to 2.69). Post-term pregnancy versus late-term pregnancy was similarly associated with an increased risk of NICU admission (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.4 to 2.9), respiratory morbidity (OR 2.7, 95\% CI 1.5 to 5.0) and infectious morbidity (OR 1.8, 95\% CI 1.2 to 2.7) and with hypoglycaemia (OR 2.6, 95\% CI 1.2 to 5.4). Post-term delivery was not associated with neonatal mortality.

	abstract = {Maternal exposure to ambient air pollution has been associated with preterm birth (PTB), however, entire pregnancy or trimester-speciﬁc associations were generally reported, which may not suﬃciently identify windows of susceptibility. Using birth registry data from Guangzhou, a megacity of southern China (population {\textasciitilde}14.5 million), including 469,975 singleton live births between January 2015 and July 2017, we assessed the association between weekly air pollution exposure and PTB in a retrospective cohort study. Daily average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3 from 11 monitoring stations were used to estimate districtspeciﬁc exposures for each participant based on their district residency during pregnancy. Distributed lag models (DLMs) incorporating Cox proportional hazard models were applied to estimate the association between weekly maternal exposure to air pollutant and PTB risk (as a time-to-event outcome), after controlling for temperature, seasonality, and individual-level covariates. We also considered moderate PTB (32–36 gestational weeks) and very PTB (28–31 gestational weeks) as outcomes of interest. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% conﬁdential intervals (95\% CIs) were calculated for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in air pollutants during the study period. An IQR increase in PM2.5 exposure during the 20th to 28th gestational weeks (27.0 μg/m3) was signiﬁcantly associated with PTB risk, with the strongest eﬀect in the 25th week (HR = 1.034, 95\% CI:1.010–1.059). The signiﬁcant exposure windows were the 19th–28th weeks for PM10, the 18th–31st weeks for NO2, and the 23rd–31st weeks for O3, respectively. The strongest associations were observed in the 25th week for PM10 (IQR = 37.0 μg/m3; HR = 1.048, 95\% CI:1.034–1.062), the 26th week for NO2 (IQR = 29.0 μg/m3; HR = 1.060, 95\% CI:1.028–1.094), and in the 28th week for O3 (IQR = 90.0 μg/m3; HR = 1.063, 95\% CI:1.046–1.081). Similar patterns were observed for moderate PTB (32–36 gestational weeks) and very PTB (28–31 gestational weeks) for PM2.5, PM10, NO2 exposure, but the eﬀects were greater for very PTB. We did not observe any association between pregnancy SO2 exposure and the risk of PTB. Our results suggest that middle to late pregnancy is the most susceptible air pollution exposure window for air pollution and PTB among women in Guangzhou, China.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a prospective birth cohort (ENVIRONAGE [Environmental Influence on Ageing in Early Life]), a total of 730 mother-newborn pairs were recruited in Flanders, Belgium between February 2010 and December 2014, all with a singleton full-term birth (Ն37 weeks of gestation). For statistical analysis, participants with full data on both cord blood and placental telomere lengths were included, resulting in a final study sample size of 641. EXPOSURES Maternal residential PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter Յ2.5 μm) exposure during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In the newborns, cord blood and placental tissue relative telomere length were measured. Maternal residential PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy was estimated using a high-resolution spatial-temporal interpolation method. In distributed lag models, both cord blood and placental telomere length were associated with average weekly exposures to PM2.5 during pregnancy, allowing the identification of critical sensitive exposure windows.
RESULTS In 641 newborns, cord blood and placental telomere length were significantly and inversely associated with PM2.5 exposure during midgestation (weeks 12-25 for cord blood and weeks 15-27 for placenta). A 5-μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 exposure during the entire pregnancy was associated with 8.8\% (95\% CI, −14.1\% to −3.1\%) shorter cord blood leukocyte telomeres and 13.2\% (95\% CI, −19.3\% to −6.7\%) shorter placental telomere length. These associations were controlled for date of delivery, gestational age, maternal body mass index, maternal age, paternal age, newborn sex, newborn ethnicity, season of delivery, parity, maternal smoking status, maternal educational level, pregnancy complications, and ambient temperature.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mothers who were exposed to higher levels of PM2.5 gave birth to newborns with shorter telomere length. The observed telomere loss in newborns by prenatal air pollution exposure indicates less buffer for postnatal influences of factors decreasing telomere length during life. Therefore, improvements in air quality may promote molecular longevity from birth onward.},

	abstract = {Background: Although effects of weather changes on human health have been widely reported, there is limited information regarding effects on pregnant women in developing countries.
Objective: We investigated the association between maternal exposure to ambient temperature and the risk of preterm birth ({\textless} 37 weeks of gestation) in Guangzhou, China.
Methods: We used a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate associations between preterm birth and average temperature during each week of gestation, with weekly temperature modeled as a time-varying exposure during four time windows: 1 week (the last week of the pregnancy), 4 weeks (the last 4 weeks of the pregnancy), late pregnancy (gestational week 20 onward), and the entire pregnancy. Information on singleton vaginal birth between 2001 and 2011 was collected. Daily meteorological data during the same period were obtained from the Guangzhou Meteorological Bureau.
Results: A total of 838,146 singleton vaginal births were included, among which 47,209 (5.6\%) were preterm births. High mean temperatures during the 4 weeks, late pregnancy, and the entire pregnancy time windows were associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. Compared with the median temperature (24.4°C), weekly exposures during the last 4 weeks of the pregnancy to extreme cold (7.6°C, the 1st percentile) and extreme heat (31.9°C, the 99th percentile) were associated with 17.9\% (95\% CI: 10.2, 26.2\%) and 10.0\% (95\% CI: 2.9, 17.6\%) increased risks of preterm birth, respectively. The association between extreme heat and preterm birth was stronger for preterm births during weeks 20–31 and 32–34 than those during weeks 35–36.
Conclusions: These findings might have important implications in preventing preterm birth in Guangzhou as well as other areas with similar weather conditions.

Cox models with each spline or FP were ﬁt to simulated datasets. The best models, e.g. degrees of freedom, were selected using default criteria for each method. The root mean-square error (rMSE) and area difference were computed to assess model ﬁt and bias (difference between the observed and true curves). The test for linearity was a measure of sensitivity and the test of the null was an assessment of statistical power. No one method performed best according to all four measures of performance, however, all methods performed reasonably well.

Methods: A distributed lag model was applied to evaluate the differences in daily mortality during heat-wave days (deﬁned using 15 HWs) compared with non-heat-wave days in Nanjing, during 2007 to 2013. For different HWs, model ﬁts were examined by the Akaike Information Criterion for quasi-Poisson and effects were compared by stratiﬁed analysis and bootstrapping. In addition, we explored the effect modiﬁcations by individual characteristics under different HWs.
Results: Different HWs resulted in considerable differences in associations between heat waves and mortality. Heat waves deﬁned as ≥ 4 consecutive days with daily average temperature N 98th percentile had the best model ﬁt and were associated with an increase of 24.6\% (95\% CI: 15.6\%, 34.3\%) total mortality, 46.9\% (95\% CI: 33.0\%, 62.3\%) cardiovascular mortality, 32.0\% (95\% CI: 8.5\%, 60.5\%) respiratory mortality, 51.3\% (95\% CI: 23.4\%, 85.6\%) stroke mortality, 63.4\% (95\% CI: 41.5\%, 88.8\%) ischemic heart disease mortality, and 47.6\% (95\% CI: 14.5\%, 90.3\%) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality at lag day 2. Under different HWs, added effects of heat waves on mortality were higher for females versus males, the elderly versus young residents, and people with low education versus those with high education. Results were less sensitive to the inclusion of air pollutants.
Conclusions: Heat wave deﬁnition plays a critical role in the relationship between heat waves and mortality. Selecting an appropriate deﬁnition of heat waves is therefore important to design local heat warning systems and to reduce the burden of disease during heat waves.},

	abstract = {Objective: To determine which measures of heatwave have the greatest predictive power for increases in health service utilisation in Perth, Western Australia.
Methods: Three heatwave formulas were compared, using Poisson or zero-inflated Poisson regression, against the number of presentations to emergency departments from all causes, and the number of inpatient admissions from heat-related causes. The period from July 2006 to June 2013 was included. A series of standardised thresholds were calculated to allow comparison between formulas, in the absence of a gold standard definition of heatwaves.
Results: Of the three heatwave formulas, Excess Heat Factor (EHF) produced the most clear dose-response relationship with Emergency Department presentations. The EHF generally predicted periods that resulted in a similar or higher rate of health service utilisation, as compared to the two other formulas, for the thresholds examined.
Conclusions: The EHF formula, which considers a period of acclimatisation as well as the maximum and minimum temperature, best predicted periods of greatest health service demand. The strength of the dose-response relationship reinforces the validity of the measure as a predictor of hazardous heatwave intensity. Implications: The findings suggest that the EHF formula is well suited for use as a means of activating heatwave plans and identifies the required level of response to extreme heatwave events as well as moderate heatwave events that produce excess health service demand.},

In the 2008/2009 summer, for example, many more lives were lost to heatwaves than to that summer’s bushfires which were among the worst in the history of the Australian nation. For many years, these other forms of natural disaster have received much greater public attention than heatwaves, although there are some signs of change. We propose a new index, called the excess heat factor (EHF) for use in Australian heatwave monitoring and forecasting. The index is based on a three-day-averaged daily mean temperature (DMT), and is intended to capture heatwave intensity as it applies to human health outcomes, although its usefulness is likely to be much broader and with potential for international applicability. The index is described and placed in a climatological context in order to derive heatwave severity. Heatwave severity, as characterised by the climatological distribution of heatwave intensity, has been used to normalise the climatological variation in heatwave intensity range across Australia. This methodology was used to introduce a pilot national heatwave forecasting service for Australia during the 2013/2014 summer. Some results on the performance of the service are presented.},

	abstract = {Background This study describes heat- and cold-related mortality in 12 urban populations in low- and middle-income countries, thereby extending knowledge of how diverse populations, in non-OECD countries, respond to temperature extremes.
Methods The cities were: Delhi, Monterrey, Mexico City, Chiang Mai, Bangkok, Salvador, Sa˜o Paulo, Santiago, Cape Town, Ljubljana, Bucharest and Sofia. For each city, daily mortality was examined in relation to ambient temperature using autoregressive Poisson models (2- to 5-year series) adjusted for season, relative humidity, air pollution, day of week and public holidays.
Results Most cities showed a U-shaped temperature-mortality relationship, with clear evidence of increasing death rates at colder temperatures in all cities except Ljubljana, Salvador and Delhi and with increasing heat in all cities except Chiang Mai and Cape Town. Estimates of the temperature threshold below which cold-related mortality began to increase ranged from 158C to 298C; the threshold for heat-related deaths ranged from 168C to 318C. Heat thresholds were generally higher in cities with warmer climates, while cold thresholds were unrelated to climate.
Conclusions Urban populations, in diverse geographic settings, experience increases in mortality due to both high and low temperatures. The effects of heat and cold vary depending on climate and nonclimate factors such as the population disease profile and age structure. Although such populations will undergo some adaptation},

The most hazardous conditions emerge when extreme daytime temperatures combine with warm night-time temperatures, high humidities and light winds for several consecutive days. Here, we assess present and future heat wave impacts on human health in Europe. Present daily physiologically equivalent temperatures (PET) are derived from the ERA-Interim reanalysis. PET allows to speciﬁcally focus on heat-related risks on humans. Regarding projections, a suite of high-resolution regional climate models –run under SRES A1B scenario– has been used. A quantile-quantile adjustment is applied to the daily simulated PET to correct biases in individual model climatologies and a multimodel ensemble strategy is adopted to encompass model errors. Two types of heat waves differently impacting human health –strong and extreme stress–are deﬁned according to speciﬁed thresholds of thermal stress and duration. Heat wave number, frequency, duration and amplitude are derived for each type. Results reveal relatively strong correlations between the spatial distribution of strong and extreme heat wave amplitudes and mortality excess for the 2003 European summer. Projections suggest a steady increase and a northward extent of heat wave attributes in Europe. Strong stress heat wave frequencies could increase more than 40 days, lasting over 20 days more by 2075-2094. Amplitudes might augment up to 7◦C per heat wave day. Important increases in extreme stress heat wave attributes are also expected: up to 40 days in frequency, 30 days in duration and 4◦C in amplitude. We believe that with this information at hand policy makers and stakeholders on vulnerable populations to heat stress can respond more effectively to the future challenges imposed by climate warming.},

	abstract = {Background: The 2003 heat wave had a high impact on mortality in Europe, which made necessary to develop heat health watch warning systems. In Spain this was carried-out by the Ministry of Health in 2004, being based on exceeding of city-specific simultaneous thresholds of minimum and maximum daily temperatures. The aim of this study is to assess effectiveness of the official thresholds established by the Ministry of Health for each provincial capital city, by quantifying and comparing the short-term effects of above-threshold days on total daily mortality.
Methods: Total daily mortality and minimum and maximum temperatures for the 52 capitals of province in Spain were collected during summer months (June to September) for the study period 1995-2004. Data was analysed using GEE for Poisson regression. Relative Risk (RR) of total daily mortality was quantified for the current day of official thresholds exceeded.
Results: The number of days in which the thresholds were exceeded show great inconsistency, with provinces with great number of exceeded days adjacent to provinces that did not exceed or rarely exceeded. The average overall excess risk of dying during an extreme heat day was about 25\% (RR = 1.24; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = [1.19-1.30]). Relative risks showed a significant heterogeneity between cities (I2 = 54.9\%). Western situation and low mean summer temperatures were associated with higher relative risks, suggesting thresholds may have been set too high in these areas.
Conclusions: This study confirmed that extreme heat days have a considerable impact on total daily mortality in Spain. Official thresholds gave consistent relative risk in the large capital cities. However, in some other cities thresholds},

	abstract = {Background Recent evidence suggests that elevated ambient temperatures may trigger preterm delivery. Since results from studies in temperate climates are inconclusive, we investigated the association between temperature and the risk of preterm birth in Flanders (Belgium).
Methods We used data on 807 835 singleton deliveries ( January 1998–July 2011). We combined a quasi-Poisson model with distributed lag non-linear models to allow for delayed and non-linear temperature effects, accounting for the daily pregnancies at risk and their gestational age distribution.
Results For moderate heat (95th vs 50th centile) up to 1 day before delivery (lag 0–1), the risk of preterm birth increased by 8.5\% (95\% CI 2.4\% to 15.0\%) when minimum temperature increased from 8.3°C to 16.3°C and by 9.6\% (95\% CI 1.1\% to 18.7\%) when maximum temperature increased from 14.7°C to 26.5°C. Corresponding estimates for extreme heat (99th vs 50th centile) were 15.6\% (95\% CI 4.8\% to 27.6\%) for minimum temperature (19.0°C vs 8.3°C) and 14.5\% (95\% CI 0.5\% to 30.6\%) for maximum temperature (30.7°C vs 14.7°C). Despite the increased risk of preterm birth associated with cold at lag 2 (and lag 1 for minimum temperature), cumulative cold effects were small. The per cent change in preterm birth associated with moderate cold (5th vs 50th centile) up to 3 days before delivery (lag 0–3) was 2.1\% (95\% CI −4.1\% to 8.7\%) for minimum temperature (−2.0°C vs 8.3°C) and 0.6\% (95\% CI −7.3\% to 9.2\%) for maximum temperature (2.5°C vs 14.7°C).

Objectives: We explored windows of vulnerability to BPA exposure in a multiethnic cohort of 228 mothers and their children from Cincinnati, Ohio.
Methods: We measured urinary BPA concentrations at up to two prenatal and six postnatal time points from the 2nd trimester of pregnancy until the child was age 8 years. At age 8 years, we administered the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2 (BASC-2), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. We estimated covariate-adjusted diﬀerences in composite scores from each instrument using a multiple informant model designed to identify heightened windows of vulnerability.
Results: Among all children, there was not strong evidence that the associations between BPA and neurobehavior varied by the timing of exposure (Visit x BPA p-values ≥ 0.16). However, child sex modiﬁed the associations of repeated BPA measures with BASC-2 scores (Visit x Sex x BPA p-values = 0.02–0.23). For example, each 10-fold increase in prenatal BPA was associated with more externalizing behaviors in girls (β = 6.2, 95\% CI: 0.8, 11.6), but not boys (β = − 0.8, 95\% CI: − 5.0, 3.4). In contrast, a 10-fold increase in 8-year BPA was associated with more externalizing behaviors in boys (β = 3.9, 95\% CI: 0.6, 7.2), but not girls (β = 0.3, 95\% CI: −3.5, 4.1).
Conclusions: We found that sex-dependent associations between BPA and child neurobehavior may depend on the timing of BPA exposure.},

OBJECTIVE: Using a longitudinal pregnancy and birth cohort, we investigated associations between triclosan exposures during diﬀerent time windows, and cognitive test scores at 8 y of age in 198 children from the HOME Study.
METHODS: We quantiﬁed triclosan in urine samples from mother–child pairs up to nine times between the second trimester of gestation and 8 y of age. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV [i.e., Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ)] assessment was administered to HOME Study children at 8 y of age. We estimated covariate-adjusted triclosan–IQ associations at each visit. We also tested whether associations between triclosan concentrations and cognitive test scores varied among exposure at diﬀerent time periods.
RESULTS: Full-Scale IQ was not signiﬁcantly associated with urinary triclosan concentrations during gestation or childhood but was signiﬁcantly associated with a 10-fold increase in maternal urinary triclosan concentration at delivery [−4:5 points (95\% CI: −7:0, −2:0)]. Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI) scores were signiﬁcantly decreased in association with urinary triclosan concentrations at delivery and at 2 y of age. Associations between repeated triclosan concentrations and cognitive test scores signiﬁcantly varied among exposure at diﬀerent time periods for Full-Scale IQ, PRI, Verbal Comprehension Index, and Working Memory (triclosan–visit interaction p ≤ 0:04).
CONCLUSION: Urinary triclosan concentrations at delivery, but not during mid to late pregnancy and childhood, were associated with signiﬁcantly lower children’s cognitive test scores at 8 y of age in this cohort of U.S. children. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2777},

	abstract = {Multiple informant data refers to information obtained from different individuals or sources used to measure the same construct; for example, researchers might collect information regarding child psychopathology from the child’s teacher and the child’s parent. Frequently, studies with multiple informants have incomplete observations; in some cases the missingness of informants is substantial. We introduce a Maximum Likelihood (ML) technique to ﬁt models with multiple informants as predictors that permits missingness in the predictors as well as the response. We provide closed form solutions when possible and analytically compare the ML technique to the existing Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) approach. We demonstrate that the ML approach can be used to compare the effect of the informants on response without standardizing the data. Simulations incorporating missingness show that ML is more efﬁcient than the existing GEE method. In the presence of MCAR missing data, we ﬁnd through a simulation study that the ML approach is robust to a relatively extreme departure from the normality assumption. We implement both methods in a study investigating the association between physical activity and obesity with activity measured using multiple informants (children and their mothers).

There were no significant effects of DBP on body weight gain of the dams during GD 6-20 or on the pups' ages of pinna detachment, incisor eruption or eye opening. Exposure to 1\% DBP prolonged gestation period, decreased body weight in both male and female pups, depressed surface righting (PND 7) in male pups, shortened forepaw grip time (PND 10), enhanced spatial learning and reference memory (PND 35) in male pups. Exposure to 0.037\% DBP also shortened forepaw grip time (PND 10), but inhibited spatial learning and reference memory in male pups. Sex x treatment effects were found in forepaw grip time (PND 10), spatial learning and reference memory, and the male pups appeared to be more susceptible than the females. However, all levels of DBP exposure did not significantly alter surface righting (PND 4), air righting (PND 16), negative geotaxis (PND 4 or 7), cliff avoidance (PND 7) or open field behavior (PND 28) in either sex. Overall, the dose level of DBP in the present study produced a few adverse effects on the neurobehavioral parameters, and it may alter cognitive abilities of the male rodent.},

Evidence is particularly strong for relations between perfluoroalkyl substances and child and adult obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, gestational diabetes, reduced birthweight, reduced semen quality, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, and breast cancer. Evidence also exists for relations between bisphenols and adult diabetes, reduced semen quality, and polycystic ovarian syndrome; phthalates and prematurity, reduced anogenital distance in boys, childhood obesity, and impaired glucose tolerance; organophosphate pesticides and reduced semen quality; and occupational exposure to pesticides and prostate cancer. Greater evidence has accumulated than was previously identified for cognitive deficits and attention-deficit disorder in children following prenatal exposure to bisphenol A, organophosphate pesticides, and polybrominated flame retardants. Although systematic evaluation is needed of the probability and strength of these exposure–outcome relations, the growing evidence supports urgent action to reduce exposure to EDCs.},

	abstract = {Endocrine disruptors possibly exert effects on neuronal functions leading, in particular, to behavioural alterations. In this study, we examined the effects of dicyclohexylphthalate (DCHP), an endocrine disruptor, on rat behavioural and cellular responses. Single intracisternal administration of DCHP (0.87–87 nmol) into 5-day-old male Wistar rats caused signiﬁcant hyperactivity at 4–5 weeks of age. It was about 1.4-fold more active in the nocturnal phase after administration of 87 nmol of DCHP than control rats (p {\textless} 0.001). The response had a tendency to be dose-dependent. Based on DNA macoarray analyses, DCHP down-regulated the levels of gene expression of the dopamine D4 receptor at 4 weeks old in both the midbrain and the striatum, and the dopamine transporter in the midbrain at 8 weeks old 1.7- to 2-fold. The gene expression of several subtypes of glutamate receptors was facilitated in the striatum at 4 weeks old and in the midbrain at 8 weeks old. Some normalization and/or compensatory changes seemed to occur in gene expression of GABA or glycine transmission. Furthermore, DCHP abolished immunoreactivity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra at 8 weeks of age, where TUNEL-positive cells were seen. We conclude that DCHP affected the developing rat brain, resulting in hyperactivity, probably as a result of degeneration of mesencephalic tyrosine hydroxylase rather than alteration of the level of gene expression.},

	abstract = {Background: Phthalates are endocrine disrupting chemicals that have been associated with adverse neuro­ behavior, but little is known about their influence on infant cognition.
Methods: A visual recognition memory task was used to assess cognition in 244 7–8-month-old infants (121 fe­ males; 123 males) from a prospective cohort study. Phthalate metabolites were quantified in maternal urines pooled from across pregnancy. The task included familiarization trials (infant shown 2 identical faces) and test trials (infant shown the now familiar face paired with a novel one). Half of the infants saw one set of faces as familiar (set 1) and half saw the other set as familiar (set 2). During familiarization trials, average run duration (time looking at stimuli before looking away, measure of processing speed), and time to familiarization (time to reach 20 s looking at the stimuli, measure of attention) were assessed. During test trials, novelty preference (proportion of time looking at the novel face, measure of recognition memory) was assessed. Multivariable generalized linear models were used to assess associations of monoethyl phthalate (MEP), sum of di(2ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (ΣDEHP), sum of di(isononyl) phthalate metabolites (ΣDINP), and sum of anti-androgenic phthalate metabolites (ΣAA) with each outcome.
Results: Mothers were mostly white and college educated, and urine phthalate concentrations were similar to those in reproductive age women in the U.S. population. All phthalate exposure biomarkers, except MEP, were associated with increases in average run duration. However, depending on the phthalate, associations were only in males or infants who saw the set 2 stimuli as familiar. Unexpectedly, ΣAA was associated with a shorter time to reach familiarization. Phthalate biomarkers also were associated with modest decrements in novelty preference, but these associations were nonsignificant.
Conclusion: Prenatal exposure to phthalates may be related to slower information processing and poorer recognition memory in infants.},

However, eye tracking in the context of development is also challenging. In this paper, we ask how knowledge on eye-tracking data quality can be used to improve eye-tracking recordings and analyses in longitudinal research so that valid conclusions about child development may be drawn. We answer this question by adopting the data-quality perspective and surveying the eye-tracking setup, training protocols, and data analysis of the YOUth study (investigating neurocognitive development of 6000 children). We ﬁrst show how our eye-tracking setup has been optimized for recording high-quality eye-tracking data. Second, we show that eye-tracking data quality can be operator-dependent even after a thorough training protocol. Finally, we report distributions of eye-tracking data quality measures for four age groups (5 months, 10 months, 3 years, and 9 years), based on 1531 recordings. We end with advice for (prospective) developmental eye-tracking researchers and generalizations to other methodologies.},

This development is apparently related to more general changes in infants’ attention and control of eye movement. As a tractable and reproducible aspect of infant behavior, the attention bias for faces can be used to examine the neural correlates of attention and may be a way to monitor early neurodevelopment in infants.},

We hypothesized that visual tracking ability in very preterm infants predicts later neurodevelopment.
Method: In 67 very preterm infants (gestational age{\textless}32 wk), eye and head movements were assessed at 4 mo corrected age while the infant tracked a moving object. Gaze gain, smooth pursuit, head movements, and timing of gaze relative the object were analyzed off line. Results of the five subscales included in the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) at 3 y of age were evaluated in relation to the visual tracking data and to perinatal risk factors.
Results: Significant correlations were obtained between gaze gain and cognition, receptive and expressive language, and fine motor function, respectively, also after controlling for gestational age, severe brain damage, retinopathy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
Conclusion: This is the first study demonstrating that the basic ability to visually track a moving object at 4 mo robustly predicts neurodevelopment at 3 y of age in children born very preterm.},

Associations of phthalate biomarkers with looking time differences (impossible–possible) were adjusted for maternal age, infant sex, and order of event presentation, and effect modiﬁcation by infant sex was assessed. Each interquartile range (IQR) increase of monoethyl phthalate in the pooled sample was associated with females’ increased looking time (β = 1.0; 95\%CI = 0.3, 1.7 s) to the impossible event.

We compared the performance of 21 children with ASD and 21 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children in a standard static search task and a dynamic search task, in which targets and distractors randomly changed locations every 500 ms, precluding the use of memory in search. Children with ASD exhibited overall faster reaction time (RT) relative to TD children, and showed no disruption in search efficiency in the dynamic condition, discounting the possibility that memory for rejected distractors augments their visual search abilities. Analyses of RT x set size functions showed no group differences in slopes but lower intercepts for the ASD group in both static and dynamic search, suggesting that the ASD advantage derived from non-search processes, such as an enhanced ability to discriminate between targets and distractors at the locus of attention. Eye-movement analyses revealed that the ASD and TD groups were similar in the number and spatial distribution of fixations across the search array, but that fixation duration was significantly shorter among children with ASD. Lower intercepts in static search were related to increased symptom severity in children with ASD. In summary, ASD search superiority did not derive from differences in the manner in which individuals with ASD deployed their attention while searching, but from anomalously enhanced perception of stimulus features, which was in turn positively associated with autism symptom severity.},

Eye-tracking has largely been used in these studies to reveal mechanisms underlying impaired task performance8 and abnormal brain functioning9, particularly during the processing of social information1,10-11. While older children and adults with ASD comprise the preponderance of research in this area, eye-tracking may be especially useful for studying young children with the disorder as it offers a non-invasive tool for assessing and quantifying early-emerging developmental abnormalities2,12-13. Implementing eye-tracking with young children with ASD, however, is associated with a number of unique challenges, including issues with compliant behavior resulting from specific task demands and disorder-related psychosocial considerations. In this protocol, we detail methodological considerations for optimizing research design, data acquisition and psychometric analysis while eye-tracking young children with ASD. The provided recommendations are also designed to be more broadly applicable for eye-tracking children with other developmental disabilities. By offering guidelines for best practices in these areas based upon lessons derived from our own work, we hope to help other investigators make sound research design and analysis choices while avoiding common pitfalls that can compromise data acquisition while eye-tracking young children with ASD or other developmental difficulties.},

	abstract = {Studies have shown that prenatal stress can negatively impact neurodevelopment, but little is known about its effect on early cognitive development. We assessed the impact of prenatal stress on cognition in 152 7.5-month-old infants using Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), maternal telomere length (MTL), and a Stressful Life Events (SLE) Scale. A visual recognition memory task consisting of nine blocks, each with one familiarization trial (two identical stimuli) followed by two test trials (one familiar stimulus, one novel), was administered. Outcomes assessed included: average time looking at stimuli (measure: processing speed), time to reach looking time criterion (measure: attention), and the proportion of time looking at the novel stimulus (measure: recognition memory). We examined the association of each stress measure with each outcome adjusted for infant age and sex, which of the two stimuli in each set was novel, household income, and maternal age, education, and IQ. Higher prenatal stress was associated with shorter looking durations [PSS (β = −1.6, 95\% CI: −2.5, −0.58); SLE (β = 0.58, 95\% CI: −0.08, 1.24); MTL (β = 1.81, 95\% CI: 0.18, 3.44)] and longer time to reach criterion [PSS (β = 9.1, 95\% CI: 1.6, 16.6); SLE (β = 12.2, 95\% CI: 1.9, 24.1); MTL (β = −23.1, 95\% CI: −45.3, −0.9)], suggesting that higher prenatal stress is associated with decreased visual attention in infancy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Children with speciﬁc language impairment (SLI) face risks for social difﬁculties. However, the nature and developmental course of these difﬁculties remain unclear. Gaze behaviors have been studied by using eye tracking among those with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Using this method, we compared the gaze behaviors of children with SLI with those of individuals with ASD and typically developing (TD) children to explore the social perception of children with SLI.
METHODS: The eye gazes of 66 children (16 with SLI, 25 with ASD, and 25 TD) were studied while viewing videos of social interactions. Gaze behaviors were summarized with multidimensional scaling, and participants with similar gaze behaviors were represented proximally in a 2-dimensional plane.
RESULTS: The SLI and TD groups each formed a cluster near the center of the multidimensional scaling plane, whereas the ASD group was distributed around the periphery. Frame-by-frame analyses showed that children with SLI and TD children viewed faces in a manner consistent with the story line, but children with ASD devoted less attention to faces and social interactions. During speech scenes, children with SLI were signiﬁcantly more ﬁxated on the mouth, whereas TD children viewed the eyes and the mouth.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with SLI viewed social situations in ways similar to those of TD children but different from those of children with ASD. However, children with SLI concentrated on the speaker’s mouth, possibly to compensate for audiovisual processing deﬁcits. Because eyes carry important information, this difference may inﬂuence the social development of children with SLI. Pediatrics 2012;129:e1453–e1460},

	abstract = {Introduction: Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are one of the leading causes of maternal and offspring mortality and morbidity. Exposure to environmental chemicals is suspected to increase blood pressure (BP) but few studies have investigated the impact of non-persistent chemicals, in particular among pregnant women.
Methods: Women included in the study were 152 volunteer participants in the Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) project. They provided 3 urine samples daily over one week in two pregnancy trimesters (at around 18 and 32 weeks of gestation) to assess their exposure to phthalates (10 metabolites), phenols (7 compounds) and organophosphate pesticides (4 metabolites). BP was measured at the end of the two collection weeks. Associations between biomarkers of exposure and BP were investigated using generalized estimating equations (GEE) and linear regression, and adjusted for potential confounders.
Results: A significant decrease in systolic and/or diastolic BP was observed with exposure to some phthalate metabolites, BPA, and parabens (e.g. β GEE models for systolic BP = −0.91 mmHg (95\%CI: −1.65; −0.17) per doubling of BPA concentrations). These associations were more frequently observed in the second trimester of pregnancy and remained statistically significant after correction for multiple testing for BPA only. No associations were observed with organophosphate pesticides.
Conclusion: This study investigates the effect of exposure to non-persistent chemicals assessed using multiple biospecimens per subject on BP during pregnancy and suggests that higher exposure to some phthalates and phenols but not pesticides is associated with lower BP during pregnancy.},

	abstract = {Objective: We performed a systematic review of the epidemiology literature to identify the neurodevelopmental effects associated with phthalate exposure. Data sources and study eligibility criteria: Six phthalates were included in the review: di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP). The initial literature search (of PubMed, Web of Science, and Toxline) included all studies of neurodevelopmental effects in humans, and outcomes were selected for full systematic review based on data availability. Study evaluation and synthesis methods: Studies of neurodevelopmental effects were evaluated using criteria defined a priori for risk of bias and sensitivity by two reviewers using a domain-based approach. Evidence was synthesized by outcome and phthalate and strength of evidence was summarized using a structured framework. For studies of cognition and motor effects in children ≤4 years old, a random effects meta-analysis was performed.
Results: The primary outcomes reviewed here are (number of studies in parentheses): cognition (14), motor effects (9), behavior, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (20), infant behavior (3), and social behavior, including autism spectrum disorder (7). For each phthalate/outcome combination, there was slight or indeterminate evidence of an association, with the exception of motor effects for BBP, which had moderate evidence.
Conclusions and implications of key findings: Overall, there is not a clear pattern of association between prenatal phthalate exposures and neurodevelopment. There are several possible reasons for the observed null associations related to exposure misclassification, periods of heightened susceptibility, sex-specific effects, and the effects of phthalate mixtures. Until these limitations are adequately addressed in the epidemiology literature, these findings should not be interpreted as evidence that there are no neurodevelopmental effects of phthalate exposure.},

The developing human central nervous system is the target organ most vulnerable to environmental chemicals. An investigation of the effects of environmental exposures on child development is a complex endeavor that requires consideration of numerous critical factors pertinent to a study’s concept, design, and execution. These include the timing of neurodevelopmental assessment, matters of biologic plausibility, site, child and population factors, data quality assurance and control, the selection of appropriate domains and measures of neurobehavior, and data safety and monitoring. Here we summarize instruments for the assessment of the neonate, infant, and child that are being employed in the Centers for Children’s Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research, sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, discuss neural and neurobiologic measures of development, and consider the promises of gene–environment studies. The vulnerability of the human central nervous system to environmental chemicals has been well established, but the contribution these exposures may make to problems such as attention deficit disorder, conduct problems, pervasive developmental disorder, or autism spectrum disorder remain uncertain. Large-scale studies such as the National Children’s Study may provide some important clues. The human neurodevelopmental phenotype will be most clearly represented in models that include environmental chemical exposures, the social milieu, and complex human genetic characteristics that we are just beginning to understand.},

	abstract = {Infant looking behaviors measured during visual assessment paradigms may be more reliable predictors of longterm cognitive outcomes than standard measures such as the Bayley Scales of Infant Development typically used in environmental epidemiology. Infrared eye tracking technology oﬀers an innovative approach to automate collection and processing of looking behavior data, making it possible to eﬃciently assess large numbers of infants. The goals of this study were to characterize infant looking behavior measures including side preference, ﬁxation duration, and novelty preference using eye tracking and an automated version of an established visual recognition memory paradigm that includes both human faces and geometric ﬁgures as stimuli. An ancillary goal was to assess the feasibility of obtaining a precise measure of looking to the eye region of faces from the eyetracking data. In this study, 309 7.5-month-old infants from a prospective birth cohort were assessed using a visual recognition memory (VRM) paradigm. Infrared eye tracking was used to record looking time as infants were shown nine blocks of trials with a pair of identical faces or shapes followed by two trials in which the familiar stimulus was paired with a novel one. Infants were assessed in one of four conditions: in conditions A and B, stimulus set 1 were the familiar stimuli and set 2 were novel; in conditions C and D, set 2 were familiar and set 1 novel. The novel stimuli were presented on the right ﬁrst in conditions A and C and on the left ﬁrst in conditions B and D. We observed a signiﬁcant right side preference, which has not been reported before (57\% of looking time spent looking at right side stimulus, p-value {\textless} 0.0001). Infants showed a preference for the novel stimuli similar to that published in prior studies (57–60\% of looking time spent looking at the novel stimulus, pvalue {\textless} 0.0001), as well as average ﬁxation durations similar to previous studies. Infants also showed a strong preference for the eyes versus the rest of the face (p-value {\textless} 0.0001). Novelty preference was signiﬁcantly higher when set 2 stimuli were novel (p-value {\textless} 0.0001), suggesting a preference among infants for set 2 stimuli compared to set 1 stimuli. The pattern of novelty preference across trials was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between infants who saw the novel stimuli on the left ﬁrst and those who saw them on the right ﬁrst (pvalue {\textless} 0.0001) but the overall mean novelty preference was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between these groups. There were also signiﬁcant diﬀerences in average ﬁxation duration and eyes preference measures across stimuli (p-values {\textless} 0.05). These ﬁndings show that VRM assessment can be automated for use in large-scale epidemiological studies using infrared eye tracking with looking behavior measure results similar to those obtained with standard non-automated methods, and that side and stimulus preferences are important modiﬁers of looking behavior that are critical to consider in this type of assessment.},

	abstract = {Eye tracking has the potential to characterize autism at a unique intermediate level, with links ‘down’ to underlying neurocognitive networks, as well as ‘up’ to everyday function and dysfunction. Because it is non-invasive and does not require advanced motor responses or language, eye tracking is particularly important for the study of young children and infants. In this article, we review eye tracking studies of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and children at risk for ASD. Reduced looking time at people and faces, as well as problems with disengagement of attention, appear to be among the earliest signs of ASD, emerging during the first year of life. In toddlers with ASD, altered looking patterns across facial parts such as the eyes and mouth have been found, together with limited orienting to biological motion. We provide a detailed discussion of these and other key findings and highlight methodological opportunities and challenges for eye tracking research of young children with ASD. We conclude that eye tracking can reveal important features of the complex picture of autism.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Eye-gaze methods have the potential to advance the study of neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite their increasing use, challenges arise in using these methods with individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and in reporting sufficient methodological detail such that the resulting research is replicable and interpretable.
            
            
              Method
              This tutorial presents key considerations involved in designing and conducting eye-gaze studies for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and proposes conventions for reporting the results of such studies.
            
            
              Results
              Methodological decisions (e.g., whether to use automated eye tracking or manual coding, implementing strategies to scaffold children's performance, defining valid trials) have cascading effects on the conclusions drawn from eye-gaze data. Research reports that include specific information about procedures, missing data, and selection of participants will facilitate interpretation and replication.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Eye-gaze methods provide exciting opportunities for studying neurodevelopmental disorders. Open discussion of the issues presented in this tutorial will improve the pace of productivity and the impact of advances in research on neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {Background: There are increasing concerns over adverse effects of prenatal phthalate exposure on the neurodevelopment of infants.
Objectives: Our goal was to explore the association between prenatal di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and dibutyl phthalate exposure and the Mental and Psychomotor Developmental Indices (MDI and PDI, respectively) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 6 months, as part of the Mothers and Children’s Environmental Health Study.
Methods: Between 2006 and 2009, 460 mother–infant pairs from Seoul, Cheonan, and Ulsan, Korea, participated. Prenatal mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2-ethyl5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) were measured in one urine sample acquired from each mother during the third trimester of pregnancy. Associations with logtransformed creatinine-corrected phthalate concentrations were estimated using linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders.
Results: MDI was inversely associated with the natural log concentrations (micrograms per gram creatinine) of MEHHP [β = –0.97; confidence interval (CI), –1.85 to –0.08] and MEOHP (β = –0.95; CI, –1.87 to –0.03), and PDI was inversely associated with MEHHP (β = –1.20; CI, –2.33 to –0.08). In males, MDI was inversely associated with MEHHP (β = –1.46; CI, –2.70 to –0.22), MEOHP (β = –1.57; CI, –2.87 to –0.28), and MBP (β = –0.93; CI, –1.82 to –0.05); PDI was inversely associated with MEHHP (β = –2.36; CI, –3.94 to –0.79), MEOHP (β = –2.05; CI, –3.71 to –0.39), and MBP (β = –1.25; CI, –2.40 to –0.11). No significant linear associations were observed for females.
Conclusions: The results suggest that prenatal exposure to phthalates may be inversely associated with the MDI and PDI of infants, particularly males, at 6 months.},

	abstract = {Background: Prior research has demonstrated inverse associations between maternal prenatal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and cognitive development assessed in preschool and school-aged children. While there are a limited number of studies that evaluated these associations during infancy, no study has evaluated whether these associations exist when using the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence (FTII), which captures novelty preference as a function of visual recognition memory.
Objective: We evaluated associations between phthalate metabolite concentrations in maternal prenatal urine and cognition in infancy using the FTII at 27 weeks and determine if these associations are sex-speciﬁc.
Methods: Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) and four di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites (DEHP) were quantiﬁed in urine samples collected from 168 minority women living in urban neighborhoods during their third trimester of pregnancy. The FTII was administered to infants at 27 weeks to measure visual recognition memory and was recorded as the novelty preference score.
Results: There were no associations between prenatal phthalate metabolite concentrations and novelty preference score in the full sample. However, there was evidence of eﬀect modiﬁcation by infant sex. Sexstratiﬁed models demonstrated that compared to girls in the lowest tertile of MBzP concentrations, girls in tertiles 2 and 3 had, on average, 3.98 and 4.65 points lower novelty preference scores (p-value=0.04 and 0.03, respectively). The relationship was similar for ΣDEHP, MiBP, and MEP. Eﬀects among boys were inconsistent and generally not signiﬁcant.
Conclusion: Maternal prenatal exposure to some phthalates was negatively associated with visual recognition memory as measured by the FTII among girls at age 27 weeks.},

Structural equation models of continuity were assessed for each domain, in which it was assumed that infant abilities→toddler abilities→11-year abilities. Abilities at each age were represented by latent variables, which minimize task-specific variance and measurement error. The model for each domain fit the data. Moreover, abilities from the three age periods predicted global outcome, with infant, toddler, and contemporaneous 11-year measures, respectively, accounting for 12.3\%, 18.5\%, and 45.2\% of the variance in 11-year IQ. These findings strengthen contentions that specific cognitive abilities that can be identified in infancy show long-term continuity and contribute importantly to later cognitive competence.},

	abstract = {Looking behavior plays a crucial role in the daily life of an infant and forms the basis for cognitive and social development. The infant’s visual attentional systems undergo rapid development during the ﬁrst few months of life. During the last decennia, the study of visual attentional development in infants has received increasing interest. Several reliable measures to investigate the early development of attentional processes have been developed, and currently a number of new methods are giving fresh impetus to the ﬁeld. Research on overt and covert as well as exogenously and endogenously controlled attention shifts is presented. The development of gaze shifts to peripheral targets, covert attention, and visual scanning behavior is treated. Whereas most attentional mechanisms in very young infants are thought to be mediated mainly by subcortical structures, cortical mechanisms become increasingly more functional throughout the ﬁrst months. Different accounts of the neurophysiological underpinnings of attentional processes and their developmental changes are discussed. Finally, a number of studies investigating the implications of attentional development for early cognitive and social development are presented.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.envint.2019.105185},
	abstract = {Background: Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are xenobiotics with the ability to interfere with hormone action, even at low levels. Prior environmental epidemiology studies link numerous suspected EDCs, including phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, results for some chemicals were inconsistent and most assessed one chemical at a time.
Objectives: To evaluate the overall impact of prenatal exposure to an EDC mixture on neurodevelopment in school-aged children, and identify chemicals of concern while accounting for co-exposures.
Methods: Among 718 mother-child pairs from the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy study (SELMA) study, we used Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression to assess the association between 26 EDCs measured in 1st trimester urine or blood, with Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (IV) Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores at age 7 years. Models were adjusted for child sex, gestational age, mother’s education, mother’s IQ (RAVEN), weight, and smoking status. To evaluate generalizability, we conducted repeated holdout validation, a machine learning technique.
Results: Using repeated holdout validation, IQ scores were 1.9-points (CI = −3.6, −0.2) lower among boys for an inter-quartile-range (IQR) change in the WQS index. BPF made the largest contribution to the index with a weight of 14\%. Other chemicals of concern and their weights included PBA (9\%), TCP (9\%), MEP (6\%), MBzP (4\%), PFOA (6\%), PFOS (5\%), PFHxS (4\%), Triclosan (5\%), and BPA (4\%). While we did observe an inverse association between EDCs and IQ among all children when training and testing the WQS index estimate on the full dataset, these results were not robust to repeated holdout validation.
Conclusion: Among boys, early prenatal exposure to EDCs was associated with lower intellectual functioning at age 7. We identified bisphenol F as the primary chemical of concern, suggesting that the BPA replacement compound may not be any safer for children. Future studies are needed to confirm the potential neurotoxicity of replacement analogues.},

This study aimed to examine associations between maternal serum levels of BPA and phthalate metabolites and behavioral problems at preschool age.
Methods: The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to assess behavioral problems at 5 years of age. BPA and phthalate metabolite levels in the first trimester maternal serum was determined by LC-MS/MS for 458 children. Variables used for adjustment were parental ages, maternal cotinine levels, family income during pregnancy, child sex, birth order, and age at SDQ completed.
Results: The median concentrations of BPA, MnBP, MiBP, MEHP, and MECPP, primary and secondary metabolites of phthalates, were 0.062, 26.0, 7.0, 1.40, and 0.20 ng/ml, respectively. MECPP level was associated with increase conduct problem risk (OR = 2.78, 95\% CI 1.36–5.68) overall and the association remained after child sex stratification, and odds ratios were increased with wider confidence interval (OR = 2.85, 95\% CI 1.07–7.57 for boys, OR = 4.04, 95\% CI 1.31–12.5 for girls, respectively). BPA, ∑DBPm (MnBP + MiBP), and ∑DEHPm (MEHP+MECPP) levels were not associated with any of the child behavioral problems.
Conclusions: Our analyses found no significant association between BPA or summation of phthalate metabolite levels and any of the behavioral problems at 5 years of age but suggested possible association between MECPP levels and increased risk of conduct problems.},

	abstract = {Background: There are concerns that developmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals such as phenolic compounds and phthalates could affect child cognitive function. Epidemiological studies tackling this question have mainly focused on phthalate metabolites and bisphenol A, but not on the other phenolic compounds. Our study aimed to assess the relationship between in-utero exposure to phthalates, bisphenol A and other phenolic compounds (parabens, triclosan, dichlorophenols and benzophenone-3) and the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of boys at 5–6 years.
Methods: In 452 mother-son dyads from the French EDEN cohort, we measured 11 phthalate metabolites and 9 phenolic compounds (4 parabens, benzophenone-3, bisphenol A, 2 dichlorophenols and triclosan) in spot urine samples collected between 22 and 29 gestational weeks. Verbal and performance IQ of children were assessed at 5–6 years by a psychologist using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). We used adjusted Structural Equation Models (SEM) combined with Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction to assess the associations between maternal urine phenol and phthalate metabolite concentrations considered simultaneously and the boys’ IQ.
Results: No phenol or phthalate metabolite concentration was negatively associated with the boys’ verbal or performance IQ (uncorrected p-values ≥0.09). Mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate tended to be associated with increased verbal IQ (β = 0.136, 95\% confidence interval, 0.01; 0.27). This association disappeared after correction for multiple comparison (corrected p-value, 0.71).
Conclusion: Our results did not provide evidence of an inverse association between in-utero exposure to phenols or phthalates and verbal and performance IQ among boys. Since phenols and phthalates may have sex-specific effects, these null findings cannot be generalized to girls. Limitations included use of a single spot urine sample to assess exposures and lack of consideration of postnatal exposures.},

	abstract = {Background: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may be involved in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders, but identifying relevant chemicals within mixtures of EDCs is difficult.
Objective: Our goal was to identify gestational EDC exposures associated with autistic behaviors.
Methods: We measured the concentrations of 8 phthalate metabolites, bisphenol A, 25 poly­ chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 6 organochlorine pesticides, 8 brominated flame retardants, and 4 perfluoroalkyl substances in blood or urine samples from 175 pregnant women in the HOME (Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment) Study (Cincinnati, OH). When children were 4 and 5 years old, mothers completed the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a measure of autistic behaviors. We examined confounder-adjusted associations between 52 EDCs and SRS scores using a twostage hierarchical analysis to account for repeated measures and confounding by correlated EDCs.
Results: Most of the EDCs were associated with negligible absolute differences in SRS scores (≤ 1.5). Each 2‑SD increase in serum concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ether-28 (PBDE‑28) (β = 2.5; 95\% CI: –0.6, 5.6) or trans-nonachlor (β = 4.1; 95\% CI: 0.8–7.3) was associated with more autistic behaviors. In contrast, fewer autistic behaviors were observed among children born to women with detectable versus nondetectable concentrations of PCB‑178 (β = –3.0; 95\% CI: –6.3, 0.2), β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β = –3.3; 95\% CI: –6.1, –0.5), or PBDE‑85 (β = –3.2; 95\% CI: –5.9, –0.5). Increasing perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) concentrations were also associated with fewer autistic behaviors (β = –2.0; 95\% CI: –4.4, 0.4).
Conclusions: Some EDCs were associated with autistic behaviors in this cohort, but our modest sample size precludes us from dismissing chemicals with null associations. PFOA, β‑hexachlorocyclohexane, PCB‑178, PBDE‑28, PBDE‑85, and trans-nonachlor deserve additional scrutiny as factors that may be associated with childhood autistic behaviors.},

	abstract = {Background: Quinolinic acid (QA), a neuroactive metabolite produced during tryptophan degradation, is implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders. Phthalates are structurally similar to QA, and exposure to phthalates has demonstrated increased QA production and excretion in rodent studies. We recently showed that very high exposure to dibutyl phthalate was associated with higher concentrations of urinary QA in men. However, no human studies examined the associations between background (low) phthalate exposures and QA.
Objectives: To examine the associations of urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites with QA.
Methods: Female participants (N = 126) who participated in a prospective cohort study at the Massachusetts General Hospital Fertility Center provided 758 urine samples (273 during pregnancy and 485 during nonpregnancy). Concentrations of 11 phthalate metabolites and QA in urine were measured. We used multivariable linear mixed effect models to estimate the percent change in urinary QA concentrations associated with a doubling (100\%) of urinary phthalate metabolite concentration, and evaluated whether there was effect modification by pregnancy status.
Results: Women’s mean (standard deviation) age was 34.2 (4.0) years with a body mass index of 23.5 (3.7) kg/ m2. The women were primarily Caucasian (92\%), had at least a college degree (98\%), and none were current smokers. Pairwise Spearman correlations between concentrations for phthalate metabolites and QA measured in the same urine samples ranged from 0.36 for MEHP to 0.68 for dibutyl phthalate (DBP) metabolites. In multivariable-adjusted models, the percent change in urinary QA concentrations was significantly higher for each doubling of several urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations. For example, each doubling of DBP metabolites was associated with a 13.7\% (95\%CI: 10.6, 16.9)\% higher QA. Associations between the low molecular weight phthalate metabolites and QA were stronger among samples collected during pregnancy as compared to nonpregnancy samples from the same women.
Conclusions: Urinary concentrations of several phthalate metabolites were positively associated with QA among women. These findings, along with the known neurotoxicity of QA, warrant the need to examine whether QA concentrations may serve as a pathway for the adverse neurodevelopment outcomes found in children’s health studies.},

	abstract = {Eye-tracking patterns in 41 pediatric subjects on the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were studied and compared to their siblings (N=30) and to age/gender matched controls (N=84). The five paradigms used were: 1-Horizontal and vertical motion video; 2-Face image; 3-Mute video of a talking face; 4-Animate/inanimate object; 5-The inverted scene. The ASD group had shorter fixation duration and less fixation count than controls. Percentage of fixation was decreased in the vertical motion video (p{\textless}0.001). Time to first fixation was significantly longer in the ASD group for the first horizontal motion video but not for the second vertical video. The ASD group, when presented with the face image, fixated faster on the mouth than controls (p=0.042), but with lower fixation duration and count. For the mute talking face video, first fixation on the eyes was slower than controls (p=0.006) with no observed effect of dynamic movement of the mouth compared to the static face image. Both ASD subjects and controls showed faster and longer fixation on the animate object image (p=0.001). The ASD group showed a decreased fixation count (p=0.014) with the inverted scene. Siblings were similar to the control group in most paradigms tested. Using the Plusoptix photo screener, all participants were screened for ocular disorders. Five \% had astigmatism and 5\% had exotropia in the ASD group. Seven \% of the siblings had astigmatism. Twenty seven \% of the control group had refractive errors. When correcting for SE by a regression model, no difference was found in eye tracking results with no association between eye-tracking parameters and refractive errors. In conlusion, children in the ASD group exhibited preferential mouth fixation, decreased general attention to all paradigms, and preferential fixation on animate versus inanimate targets.},

They are cited widely as a diagnostic feature4 and figure prominently in clinical instruments5; however, the early onset of these deficits has not been known. Here we show in a prospective longitudinal study that infants later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) exhibit mean decline in eye fixation within the first 2 to 6 months of life, a pattern not observed in infants who do not develop ASD. These observations mark the earliest known indicators of social disability in infancy, but also falsify a prior hypothesis: in the first months of life, this basic mechanism of social adaptive action—eye looking—is not immediately diminished in infants later diagnosed with ASD; instead, eye looking appears to begin at normative levels prior to decline. The timing of decline highlights a narrow developmental window and reveals the early derailment of processes that would otherwise play a key role in canalizing typical social development. Finally, the observation of this decline in eye fixation—rather than outright absence—offers a promising opportunity for early intervention, one that could build on the apparent preservation of mechanisms subserving reflexive initial orientation towards the eyes.},

Results suggest that individuals with ASD do not exhibit more normative gaze patterns when viewing familiar faces. A second task assessed facial recognition accuracy and response time for familiar and novel faces. The groups did not differ on accuracy or reaction times.},

	abstract = {Recent work suggests that executive functions, the cornerstone of higher-level cognitive operations, are driven by basic information processing abilities. Using structural equation modeling, with latent variables, the present study provides the first evidence that this driving force begins in infancy, such that abilities in infancy predict executive functions at age 11. Information processing abilities in three domains (attention, processing speed, and memory) were assessed when participants were infants (7 and 12 months) and toddlers (24 and 36 months) and were used to predict three executive functions (working memory, inhibition, and shifting) when participants were 11 years old. A model relating infant abilities to age-11 executive functions fit well, and accounted for 9\% to 19\% of the variance in the executive functions. Paths from both Speed and Memory in infancy to age-11 Working Memory were significant, as was the path from Speed in infancy to age-11 Shifting. A model using abilities in toddlerhood as predictors fit similarly. These findings implicate early basic cognitive abilities in the development of executive functions.},

While new methods such as mobile eye tracking and eye tracking in virtual/augmented realities are emerging quickly, the eye-movement terminology has scarcely been revised. We assert that this may cause confusion about two of the main concepts: fixations and saccades. In this study, we assessed the definitions of fixations and saccades held in the eye-movement field, by surveying 124 eye-movement researchers. These eye-movement researchers held a variety of definitions of fixations and saccades, of which the breadth seems even wider than what is reported in the literature. Moreover, these definitions did not seem to be related to researcher background or experience. We urge researchers to make their definitions more explicit by specifying all the relevant components of the eye movement under investigation: (i) the oculomotor component: e.g. whether the eye moves slow or fast; (ii) the functional component: what purposes does the eye movement (or lack thereof) serve; (iii) the coordinate system used: relative to what does the eye move; (iv) the computational definition: how is the event represented in the eye-tracker signal. This should enable eye-movement researchers from different fields to have a discussion without misunderstandings.},

The relationship between adverse environmental exposures frequently associated with factors operating in the prepregnancy period and during fetal development is well established. Also well appreciated are the developmental impacts (both short- and long-term) associated with postnatal factors, such as immunostimulation and environmental enteropathy, and the additional risks posed by the confluence of factors related to malnutrition, poor living conditions, and the high burden of infections. This article provides our current thinking on the pathogenesis and risk factors for adverse developmental outcomes among young children, setting the scene for potential interventions that can ameliorate these adversities among families and children at risk.},

Ever-increasing sophisticated diagnostic tools have been continuously revealing a remarkably complex architecture that embraces genetic mutations of distinct types (chromosomal rearrangements, copy number variants, small indels, and nucleotide substitutions) with distinct frequencies in the population (common, rare, de novo). Such a network of interacting players creates difficulties in establishing rigorous genotype-phenotype correlations. Furthermore, individual lifestyles may also contribute to the severity of the symptoms fueling a large spectrum of gene-environment interactions that have a key role on the relationships between genotypes and phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Down syndrome (DS) is caused by trisomy of all or part of human chromosome 21 (HSA21) and is the most common genetic cause of signiWcant intellectual disability. In addition to intellectual disability, many other health problems, such as congenital heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, leukemia, hypotonia, motor disorders, and various physical anomalies occur at an elevated frequency in people with DS. On the other hand, people with DS seem to be at a decreased risk of certain cancers and perhaps of atherosclerosis. There is wide variability in the phenotypes associated with DS. Although ultimately the phenotypes of DS must be due to trisomy of HSA21, the genetic mechanisms by which the phenotypes arise are not understood. The recent recognition that there are many genetically active elements that do not encode proteins makes the situation more complex. Additional complexity may exist due to possible epigenetic changes that may act diVerently in DS. Numerous mouse models with features reminiscent of those seen in individuals with DS have been produced and studied in some depth, and these have added considerable insight into possible genetic mechanisms behind some of the phenotypes. These mouse models allow experimental approaches, including attempts at therapy, that are not possible in humans. Progress in understanding the genetic mechanisms by which trisomy of HSA21 leads to DS is the subject of this review.},

            Recent data indicate that approximately 12\% of children in the United States are affected by neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disorders, intellectual disabilities, and autism spectrum disorders. Accumulating evidence indicates a multifactorial etiology for these disorders, with social, physical, genetic susceptibility, nutritional factors, and chemical toxicants acting together to influence risk. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals during the early stages of life can disrupt normal patterns of development and thus alter brain function and disease susceptibility later in life. This article highlights research efforts and pinpoints approaches that could shed light on the possible associations between environmental chemicals that act on the endocrine system and compromised neurodevelopmental outcomes.},

Lead is soft and malleable, and has a relatively low melting point. When freshly cut, lead is silvery with a hint of blue; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and concludes three major decay chains of heavier elements. Lead is a relatively unreactive post-transition metal. Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; lead and its oxides react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to bond with itself; it can form chains, rings and polyhedral structures.},

Although pesticide application serves many important purposes, including protection against crop loss and against vector borne diseases, there are significant concerns over the potential toxic effects of pesticides to non-target organisms, including humans. In many cases, the molecular target of a pesticide is shared by non-target species, leading to the potential for untoward effects. Here, we review the history of pesticide usage and the neurotoxicity of selected classes of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides and fungicides, to humans and experimental animals. Specific emphasis is given to linkages between exposure to pesticides and risk of neurological disease and dysfunction in humans coupled with mechanistic findings in humans and animal models. Finally, we discuss emerging techniques and strategies to improve translation from animal models to humans.},

	abstract = {Environmental phenols are a group of chemicals with widespread uses in consumer and personal care products, food and beverage processing, and in pesticides. We assessed exposure to benzophenone-3, bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan, methyl- and propyl parabens, and 2,4- and 2,5dichlorophenol or their precursors in 506 pregnant women enrolled in the National Children’s Study (NCS) Vanguard Study. We measured the urinary concentrations of the target phenols by using online solid-phase extraction-isotope dilution high performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry. NCS women results were compared to those of 524 similar-aged women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009–2010, and to 174 pregnant women in NHANES 2005–2010. In the NCS women, we found significant racial/ ethnic differences (p{\textless}0.05) in regression adjusted mean concentrations of benzophenone-3, triclosan, 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenol, but not of BPA. Urinary 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenol concentrations were highly correlated (r=0.66, p{\textless}0.0001). Except for BPA and triclosan, adjusted mean concentrations were significantly different across the 7 study sites. Education was marginally significant for benzophenone-3, triclosan, propyl paraben, and 2,5-dichlorophenol. Urinary concentrations of target phenols in NCS pregnant women and U.S. women and pregnant women were similar. In NCS pregnant women, race/ethnicity and geographic location determined urinary concentrations of most phenols (except BPA), suggesting differential exposures. NCS Main Study protocols should collect urine biospecimens and information about exposures to environmental phenols.},

	abstract = {Phthalates (diesters of phthalic acid) are widely used as plasticizers and additives in many consumer products. Laboratory animal studies have reported the endocrine-disrupting and reproductive eﬀects of phthalates, and human exposure to this class of chemicals is a concern. Several phthalates have been recognized as substances of high concern. Human exposure to phthalates occurs mainly via dietary sources, dermal absorption, and air inhalation. Phthalates are excreted as conjugated monoesters in urine, and some phthalates, such as di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), undergo secondary metabolism, including oxidative transformation, prior to urinary excretion. The occurrence of phthalates and their metabolites in urine, serum, breast milk, and semen has been widely reported. Urine has been the preferred matrix in human biomonitoring studies, and concentrations on the order of several tens to hundreds of nanograms per milliliter have been reported for several phthalate metabolites. Metabolites of diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl- (DBP) and diisobutyl- (DiBP) phthalates, and DEHP were the most abundant compounds measured in urine. Temporal trends in phthalate exposures varied among countries. In the United States (US), DEHP exposure has declined since 2005, whereas DiNP exposure has increased. In China, DEHP exposure has increased since 2000. For many phthalates, exposures in children are higher than those in adults. Human epidemiological studies have shown a signiﬁcant association between phthalate exposures and adverse reproductive outcomes in women and men, type II diabetes and insulin resistance, overweight/obesity, allergy, and asthma. This review compiles biomonitoring studies of phthalates and exposure doses to assess health risks from phthalate exposures in populations across the globe.},

	abstract = {Phthalates are used as plasticizers to increase durability, resistivity and ﬂexibility of plastic materials. The commonly used phthalate, diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is used in different plastic materials like food packaging, toys and medical devices. DEHP has been linked to different toxicities in humans as well as in animals, and as a consequence other phthalates, including dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP) are being introduced. The increased use of phthalates has resulted in contamination of aquatic ecosystem and it directly threatens the aquatic life. In this study, we analyzed the effects of three phthalates DEHP, DEP and DBP using freshwater organism Daphnia magna. Although, exposure of the three phthalates at 1 and 10 μM did not result any lethality and hatching delay, the chronic exposure for 14 days resulted in reduction of body length. There was enhanced fat accumulation on exposure to all the phthalates, as indicated by oil red O staining. qRT-PCR analysis of genes involved in fat metabolism suggests that the increase in fat content could be due to inhibition of absorption and catabolism of fatty acids. Reproduction analysis showed that DBP and DEP did not alter fecundity but surprisingly, DEHP at 1 μM increased reproduction by 1.5 fold compared to control group. Phthalates also showed negative effect on lifespan as DEP at 10 μM and DBP at both 1 and 10 μM signiﬁcantly reduced the lifespan. Our data indicates that along with the banned phthalate DEHP, the other substitute phthalates DEP and DBP could also have detrimental effect on aquatic organisms.},

	abstract = {Background: Environmental phenols, such as parabens, bisphenol A, and triclosan, are ubiquitous in indoor en­ vironments because of their use in packaging, plastics, personal care products, and as anti-microbials. The pri­ mary pathways of exposure, as well as habits and behaviors that may lead to greater exposure, are still unclear.
Objectives: Herein, we investigate the relationships between phenols found in residential environments by comparing levels in paired samples of house dust and hand wipes with children’s urine. In addition, phenols were analyzed in a novel exposure tool, the silicone wristbands, to investigate which external matrix best correlates with individual exposure based on urinary phenol biomarkers.
Methods: Children aged 3–6 years in central North Carolina, United States, provided paired hand wipe (n = 202), wristband (n = 76), and spot urine samples (n = 180), while legal guardians completed questionnaires on habits and behaviors. House dust samples (n = 186) were collected from the main living area during home visits completed between 2014 and 2016.
Results: Environmental phenols were detected frequently in all matrices investigated. Ethyl, methyl, and pro­ pylparaben levels observed in hand wipes, dust, and on wristbands were significantly correlated to their asso­ ciated urinary biomarkers. In addition, intra-paraben correlations were noted, with biomarkers of ethyl, methyl, and propylparabens generally positively and significantly correlated, which suggests co-application of parabens in products. Triclosan levels in dust were positive and significantly correlated with levels in hand wipes and wristbands and with urinary concentrations, suggesting non-personal care product sources may be important in children’s overall triclosan exposure. Generally, chemicals on wristbands were more highly correlated with urinary biomarkers than with chemicals in hand wipes or house dust. In addition, more frequent lotion use was positively associated with urinary concentrations of paraben biomarkers.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that the home environment is an important source of exposure which has been under-investigated for some environmental phenols (e.g., triclosan in house dust). Associations between wrist­ bands and biomarkers of exposure, which were stronger than for hand wipes and house dust, suggest that silicone wristbands may provide a suitable exposure assessment tool for some phenols.},

Infants learned about the association between faces that were superimposed on unique scenic backgrounds. During test trials, infants were shown three faces presented on a familiar scene. All three faces were equally familiar; however, one had been presented with the test background earlier. Visual behavior was recorded continuously using a TOBII eye tracker. Infants looked preferentially at the face that matched the test background very early in the trial; however, the time course of this preferential looking effect varied as a function of delay. These results suggest that by 9 months of age infants can form memories that represent the relations among items and maintain them over short delays.},

Methods: We measured the efﬁciency of disengaging from a central visual stimulus to orient to a peripheral one in a cohort of 104 infants with and without familial risk for autism by virtue of having an older sibling with autism.
Results: At 7 months of age, disengagement was not robustly associated with later diagnostic outcomes. However, by 14 months, longer latencies to disengage in the subset of the risk group later diagnosed with autism was observed relative to other infants at risk and the low-risk control group. Moreover, between 7 months and 14 months, infants who were later diagnosed with autism at 36 months showed no consistent increases in the speed and ﬂexibility of visual orienting. However, the latter developmental effect also characterized those infants who exhibited some form of developmental concerns (but not meeting criteria for autism) at 36 months.
Conclusions: Infants who develop autism or other developmental concerns show atypicality in the development of visual attention skills from the ﬁrst year of life.},

	abstract = {In addition to core symptoms, i.e., social interaction and communication difﬁculties and restricted and repetitive behaviors, autism is also characterized by aspects of superior perception [1]. One well-replicated ﬁnding is that of superior performance in visual search tasks, in which participants have to indicate the presence of an odd-one-out element among a number of foils [2–5]. Whether these aspects of superior perception contribute to the emergence of core autism symptoms remains debated [4, 6]. Perceptual and social interaction atypicalities could reﬂect coexpressed but biologically independent pathologies, as suggested by a ‘‘fractionable’’ phenotype model of autism [7]. A developmental test of this hypothesis is now made possible by longitudinal cohorts of infants at high risk, such as of younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Around 20\% of younger siblings are diagnosed with autism themselves [8], and up to another 30\% manifest elevated levels of autism symptoms [9]. We used eye tracking to measure spontaneous orienting to letter targets (O, S, V, and +) presented among distractors (the letter X; Figure 1). At 9 and 15 months, emerging autism symptoms were assessed using the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI; [10]), and at 2 years of age, they were assessed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS; [11]). Enhanced visual search performance at 9 months predicted a higher level of autism symptoms at 15 months and at 2 years. Infant perceptual atypicalities are thus intrinsically linked to the emerging autism phenotype.},

However, this research relies heavily on manual reaction time (RT) measures that cannot fully delineate the time course and components of attentional bias. Eye tracking technology, which allows relatively direct and continuous measurement of overt visual attention, may provide an important supplement to RT measures. This article reviews eye tracking research on anxiety and depression, evaluating the experimental paradigms and eye movement indicators used to study attentional biases. Also included is a meta-analysis of extant eye tracking research (33 experiments; N =1579) on both anxiety and depression. Relative to controls, anxious individuals showed increased vigilance for threat during free viewing and visual search, and showed difﬁculty disengaging from threat in visual search tasks, but not during free viewing. In contrast, depressed individuals were not characterized by vigilance for threat during free viewing, but were characterized by reduced orienting to positive stimuli, as well as reduced maintenance of gaze on positive stimuli and increased maintenance of gaze on dysphoric stimuli. Implications of these ﬁndings for theoretical accounts of attentional bias in anxiety and depression are discussed, and avenues for future research using eye-tracking technology are outlined.},

Trace levels of TCS continue to be detected in many organisms, and it has been shown to be particularly toxic to aquatic species. The mechanisms underlying TCS-mediated toxicity include hormone dyshomeostasis, induction of oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation. Although TCS has been considered to be non-toxic to mammals, the adverse effects of continuous, long-term and low concentration exposure remain unknown. Epidemiological studies revealed that levels of TCS in human tissues, urine, plasma and breast milk correlate with the usage of this antimicrobial. This led to concerns regarding TCS safety and potential toxicity in humans, with special emphasis on early development. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued a directive banning the use of TCS in consumer soaps, justifying the move attributed to data gaps on its effectiveness and safety, indicating the need for more studies addressing this chemical-mediated effects on various tissues including the central nervous system (CNS). The aim of this review was to (1) summarize the current findings on the neurotoxic effects of TCS and given the paucity of data, to (2) broaden the discussion to other effects of TCS, which might plausibly be related to neuronal functions.},

	abstract = {Today, topical application of sunscreens, containing ultraviolet-ﬁlters (UV-ﬁlters), is preferred protection against adverse effects of ultraviolet radiation. Evidently, use of sunscreens is effective in prevention of sunburns in various models. However, evidence for their protective effects against melanoma skin cancer is less conclusive. Three important observations prompted us to review the animal data and human studies on possible side effects of selected chemical UV-ﬁlters in cosmetics. (1) the utilization of sunscreens with UV-ﬁlters is increasing worldwide; (2) the incidence of the malignant disorder for which sunscreens should protect, malignant melanoma, is rapidly increasing and (3) an increasing number of experimental studies indicating that several UV-ﬁlters might have endocrine disruptive effects. The selected UV-ﬁlters we review in this article are benzophenone-3 (BP-3), 3-benzylidene camphor (3-BC), 3-(4methyl-benzylidene) camphor (4-MBC), 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxy cinnamate (OMC), Homosalate (HMS), 2-ethylhexyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate (ODPABA) and 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). The potential adverse effects induced by UV-ﬁlters in experimental animals include reproductive ⁄ developmental toxicity and disturbance of hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis (HPT). Few human studies have investigated potential side effects of UV-ﬁlters, although human exposure is high as UV-ﬁlters in sunscreens are rapidly absorbed from the skin. One of the UV-ﬁlters, BP-3, has been found in 96\% of urine samples in the US and several UV-ﬁlters in 85\% of Swiss breast milk samples. It seems pertinent to evaluate whether exposure to UV-ﬁlters contribute to possible adverse effects on the developing organs of foetuses and children.},

	abstract = {The essential roles of thyroid hormone (TH) in perinatal brain development have been known for decades. More recently, many of the molecular mechanisms underlying the multiple effects of TH on proliferation, differentiation, migration, synaptogenesis and myelination in the developing nervous system have been elucidated. At the same time data from both epidemiological studies and animal models have revealed that the inﬂuence of thyroid signaling on development of the nervous system, extends to all periods of life, from early embryogenesis to neurogenesis in the adult brain. This review focuses on recent insights into the actions of TH during early neurogenesis. A key concept is that, in contrast to the previous ideas that only the unliganded receptor was implicated in these early phases, a critical role of the ligand, T3, is increasingly recognized. These ﬁndings are considered in the light of increasing knowledge of cell speciﬁc control of T3 availability as a function of deiodinase activity and transporter expression. These requirements for TH in the early stages of neurogenesis take on new relevance given the increasing epidemiological data on adverse effects of TH lack in early pregnancy on children's neurodevelopmental outcome. These ideas lead logically into a discussion on how the actions of TH during the ﬁrst phases of neurogenesis can be potentially disrupted by gestational iodine lack and/or chemical pollution.

	abstract = {Background: Increasing scientific evidence suggests that exposure to phthalates during pregnancy may be associated with an elevated risk of adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm birth. Maternal endocrine disruption across pregnancy may be one pathway mediating some of these relationships. We investigated whether urinary phthalate metabolites were associated with maternal serum thyroid (free thyroxine [FT4], free triiodothyronine [FT3], and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]), and sex (estradiol, progesterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG]) hormone levels at multiple time points during pregnancy.
Methods: Preliminary data (n = 106) were obtained from an ongoing prospective birth cohort in Northern Puerto Rico. We collected urine and serum sample at the first and third study visits that occurred at 18 +/− 2 and 26 +/− 2 weeks of gestation, respectively. To explore the longitudinal relationships between urinary phthalate metabolites and serum thyroid and sex hormone concentrations, we used linear mixed models (LMMs) adjusted for prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and maternal age. An interaction term was added to each LMM to test whether the effect of urinary phthalate metabolites on serum thyroid and sex hormone levels varied by study visit. In cross-sectional analyses, we stratified BMI- and age-adjusted linear regression models by study visit.
Results: In adjusted LMMs, we observed significant inverse associations between mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) and FT3 and between mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) and progesterone. In cross-sectional analyses by study visit, we detected stronger and statistically significant inverse associations at the third study visit between FT3 and MCPP as well as mono-carboxyisooctyl phthalate (MCOP); also at the third study visit, significant inverse associations were observed between FT4 and metabolites of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). The inverse association between MEP and progesterone was consistent across study visits.
Conclusions: In this group of pregnant women, urinary phthalate metabolites may be associated with altered maternal serum thyroid and sex hormone levels, and the magnitude of these effects may depend on the timing of exposure during gestation.},

	abstract = {Background Widespread phthalate exposure has prompted investigations concerning their potential adverse health effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of pre and early postnatal phthalate exposure on child psychomotor development basing on the data from the prospective Polish Mother and Child Cohort Study (REPRO PL).
Methods Phthalate exposure was determined by measuring 11 phthalate metabolites (MEP, MiBP, MnBP, 3OH-MnBP, MBzP, MEHP, 5OH-MEHP, 5oxo-MEHP, 7OH-MiNP, 7oxo-MiNP, MnOP) in the urine collected from mothers during the third trimester of pregnancy (prenatal exposure) and from their children at 24 th month of age (postnatal exposure). The analysis was performed by HPLC-MS/MS method. Child psychomotor development was assessed at the 2 nd year of age by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development.
Results Child motor development was inversely associated with natural log concentrations (mg/g creatinine) of 3OH-MnBP (b=2.3; 95\% CI -4.0 to -0.6), 5OH-MEHP (b=-1.2; 95\% CI -2.2 to -0.3), 5oxo-MEHP (b=-1.8; 95\% CI -330 to -0.2) and DEHP metabolites (b=-2.2; 95\% CI -3.60 to -0.8) and sum of high molecular weight phthalates (b=-2.5; 95\% CI -4.1 to -0.9) in the urine collected from mothers during pregnancy after adjustment for variety of potential confounders. Additional adjustment for postnatal phthalate exposure did not change the results. Postnatal child exposure to phthalates was not associated with any of the measured scores of child psychomotor development.
Conclusions The study findings add further support to the possibility that prenatal phthalate exposure may be detrimental to child neurodevelopment and underscore the importance of policies and public health interventions to reduce such exposure.},

Neurodevelopmental toxicity in utero may manifest as psychosocial deﬁcits later in childhood. This study investigates prenatal exposure to two ubiquitous endocrine disruptors, the phthalate esters and bisphenol A (BPA), and social behavior in a sample of adolescent inner-city children. Third trimester urines of women enrolled in the Mount Sinai Children’s Environmental Health Study between 1998 and 2002 (n = 404) were analyzed for phthalate metabolites and BPA. Mother–child pairs were asked to return for a follow-up assessment when the child was between the ages of 7 and 9 years. At this visit, mothers completed the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (n = 137), a quantitative scale for measuring the severity of social impairment related to Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in the general population. In adjusted general linear models increasing log-transformed low molecular weight (LMW) phthalate metabolite concentrations were associated with greater social deﬁcits (b = 1.53, 95\% CI 0.25–2.8). Among the subscales, LMWP were also associated with poorer Social Cognition (b = 1.40, 95\% CI 0.1–2.7); Social Communication (b = 1.86, 95\% CI 0.5–3.2); and Social Awareness (b = 1.25, 95\% CI 0.1–2.4), but not for Autistic Mannerisms or Social Motivation. No signiﬁcant association with BPA was found (b = 1.18, 95\% CI À0.75, 3.11). Prenatal phthalate exposure was associated with childhood social impairment in a multiethnic urban population. Even mild degrees of impaired social functioning in otherwise healthy individuals can have very important adverse effects over a child’s lifetime. These results extend our previous ﬁnding of atypical neonatal and early childhood behaviors in relation to prenatal phthalate exposure.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Toxicology studies have shown adverse eﬀects of developmental exposure to industrial phenols. Evaluation in humans is challenged by potentially marked within-subject variability of phenol biomarkers in pregnant women, which is poorly characterized.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to characterize within-day, between-day, and between-week variability of phenol urinary biomarker concentrations during pregnancy.
METHODS: In eight French pregnant women, we collected all urine voids over a 1-wk period (average, 60 samples per week per woman) at three occasions (15 ± 2, 24 ± 2, and 32 ± 1 gestational weeks) in 2012–2013. Aliquots of each day and of the whole week were pooled within-subject. We assayed concentrations of 10 phenols in these pools, and, for two women, in all spot (unpooled) samples collected during a 1-wk period. We characterized variability using intraclass correlation coeﬃcients (ICCs) with spot samples (within-day variability), daily pools (between-day variability), and weekly pools (between-week variability).
RESULTS: For most biomarkers, the within-day variability was high (ICCs between 0.03 and 0.50). The between-day variability, based on samples pooled within each day, was much lower, with ICCs {\textgreater}0:60 except for bisphenol S (0.14, 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.00, 0.39). The betweenweek variability diﬀered between compounds, with triclosan and bisphenol S having the lowest ICCs ({\textless}0:3) and 2,5-dichlorophenol the highest (ICC {\textgreater}0:9).
CONCLUSION: During pregnancy, phenol biomarkers showed a strong within-day variability, while the variability between days of a given week was more limited. One biospecimen is not enough to eﬃciently characterize exposure; collecting biospecimens during a single week may be enough to represent well the whole pregnancy exposure for some but not all phenols. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1994},

	abstract = {Empirical evidence suggests that exposure of Americans to dioxin-like compounds was low during the early decades of the 20th century, then increased during the 1940s and 1950s, reaching a peak in the 1960s and 1970s, and progressively decreased to lower levels in the 1980s and 1990s. Such evidence includes dioxin analysis of carbon-dated sediment cores of lakes and rivers, preserved meat samples from different decades of the 20th century, and limited body burden measurements of dioxin-like compounds. Pinsky and Lorber (1998) summarized studies measuring 2,3,7,8-TCDD in blood and adipose tissue, and found a range of 10–20 pgyg (ppt) lipid during the 1970s, and 2–10 ppt lipid during the 1980s. This study reviews body burdens of dioxin toxic equivalents, TEQs, to find a range from approximately 50 to 80 ppt lipid during the 1970s, 30–50 ppt lipid during the 1980s, and 10–20 ppt lipid during the 1990s (TEQs comprised of the 17 dioxin and furan congeners only). ,Pinsky and Lorber (1998) investigated historical exposure trends for 2,3,7,8-TCDD by using a single-compartment, first-order pharmacokinetic model. The current study extends this prior effort by modeling dioxin TEQs instead of the single compound, 2,3,7,8-TCDD. TEQs are modeled as though they were a single compound, in contrast to an approach where the individual dioxin and furan congeners are modeled separately. It was found that body burdens of TEQs during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s could be modeled by assuming a historical dose which began the century at low levels of approximately 0.5 pg TEQykgyday, rose during the middle decades of the 20th century to over 6 pg TEQykgyday, and declined to current levels of approximately 0.5 pg TEQykgyday. Trends in individual and population body burdens of TEQs are also investigated using this PK modeling framework. A key uncertainty of this effort — assuming that TEQs behave as though they were a single compound — is discussed and analyzed. ᮊ 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Phthalates are metabolized and eliminated in urine within hours after exposure. Several reports suggest that concentrations of phthalate metabolites in a spot urine sample can provide a reliable estimation of exposure to phthalates for up to several months.
Objectives: We examined inter- and intraperson and inter- and intraday variability in the concentrations of monoethyl phthalate (MEP), the major metabolite of diethyl phthalate, commonly used in personal care products, and mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), a metabolite of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a polyvinyl chloride plasticizer of which diet is the principal exposure source, among eight adults who collected all urine voids (average, 7.6 samples/person/day) for 1 week.
Methods: We analyzed the urine samples using online solid-phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution–high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry.
Results: Regardless of the type of void (spot, first morning, 24-hr collection), for MEP, interperson variability in concentrations accounted for {\textgreater} 75\% of the total variance. By contrast, for MEHHP, within-person variability was the main contributor (69–83\%) of the total variance. Furthermore, we observed considerable intraday variability in the concentrations of spot samples for MEHHP (51\%) and MEP (21\%).
Conclusions: MEP and MEHHP urinary concentrations varied considerably during 1 week, but the main contributors to the total variance differed (interday variability, MEHHP; interperson variability, MEP) regardless of the sampling strategy (spot, first morning, 24-hr collection). The nature of the exposure (diet vs. other lifestyle factors) and timing of urine sampling to evaluate exposure to phthalates should be considered. For DEHP and phthalates to which people are mostly exposed through diet, collecting 24-hr voids for only 1 day may not be advantageous compared with multiple spot collections. When collecting multiple spot urine samples, changing the time of collection may provide the most complete approach to assess exposure to diverse phthalates.},

Criteria for evaluating the scientiﬁc quality of data to support health-related quality of life (HRQL) and other patient-based labeling and promotional claims in the United States and Europe have been proposed by various scientists and organizations. Since March 2000, a working group composed of members of the International Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL), the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR), the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer’s Association Health Outcomes Committee (PhRMAHOC), and the European Regulatory Issues on Quality of Life Assessment (ERIQA) met to discuss and coordinate the various recommendations by their respective groups and address the need to harmonize outcomes review criteria within and across United States and European regulatory agencies. Over time, the discussion expanded from HRQL outcomes to include any outcome based on data provided by the patient or patient proxy, that is, patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The working group therefore became known as the PRO Harmonization Group.},

Patients with metastatic breast cancer (n  71), and metastatic prostate cancer (n  29), a partner, and the physician each completed the same QoL questionnaire indicating how they perceived the patient's QoL. The European organization for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire was used to assess patients with breast cancer and the modi®ed prostate cancer speci®c quality of life instrument (PROSQOLI) for patients with prostate cancer. There was reasonable agreement in mean scores between patients, and physicians or partners, for many domains of QoL; however, there was substantial discordance between scores when considering individual patients. For patients with metastatic breast cancer, physicians systematically underestimated overall QoL (p  0.0002), social functioning (p  0.001), and role functioning (p  0.008), while partners showed better agreement. With prostate cancer physicians tended to underestimate pain, while mean scores for spouses were more concordant. There is substantial variability between ratings of QoL by physicians or partners, as compared to patient ratings. Medical decisions should be based on information about QoL provided by patients using validated methods.},

	abstract = {This article describes the history of the diagnostic class of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) up to DSM-5. We further analyze how the development of genetics will transform the classification and diagnosis of NDDs. In DSM-5, NDDs include intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Physicians in German-, French- and English-speaking countries (eg, Weikard, Georget, Esquirol, Down, Asperger, and Kanner) contributed to the phenomenological definitions of these disorders throughout the 18th and 20th centuries. These diagnostic categories show considerable comorbidity and phenotypic overlap. NDDs are one of the chapters of psychiatric nosology most likely to benefit from the approach advocated by the National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Domain Criteria project. Genetic research supports the hypothesis that ID, ASD, ADHD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder lie on a neurodevelopmental continuum. The identification of recurrently observed copy number variants and disruptive gene variants in ASD (eg, CDH8, 16p11.2, SCN2A) led to the adoption of the genotype-first approach to characterize individuals at the etiological level.},

            Recent genetic studies reinforce the view that current approaches to the

	abstract = {The idea that disturbances occurring early in brain development contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, often referred to as the neurodevelopmental hypothesis, has become widely accepted. Despite this, the disorder is viewed as being distinct nosologically, and by implication pathophysiologically and clinically, from syndromes such as autism spectrum disorders, attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and intellectual disability, which typically present in childhood and are grouped together as “neurodevelopmental disorders”. An alternative view is that neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, rather than being etiologically discrete entities, are better conceptualized as lying on an etiological and neurodevelopmental continuum, with the major clinical syndromes reﬂecting the severity, timing and predominant pattern of abnormal brain development and resulting functional abnormalities. It has also been suggested that, within the neurodevelopmental continuum, severe mental illnesses occupy a gradient of decreasing neurodevelopmental impairment as follows: intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Recent genomic studies have identiﬁed large numbers of speciﬁc risk DNA changes and offer a direct and robust test of the predictions of the neurodevelopmental continuum model and gradient hypothesis. These ﬁndings are reviewed in detail. They not only support the view that schizophrenia is a disorder whose origins lie in disturbances of brain development, but also that it shares genetic risk and pathogenic mechanisms with the early onset neurodevelopmental disorders (intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders and ADHD). They also support the idea that these disorders lie on a gradient of severity, implying that they differ to some extent quantitatively as well as qualitatively. These ﬁndings have important implications for nosology, clinical practice and research.},

	abstract = {Background: Etiologic models of anorexia nervosa (AN) suggest that cognitive factors play a crucial role in the disorder’s psychopathology. Attentional aspects of food processing in AN remain largely unknown. Both an early attentional bias (vigilance) and inattentiveness (avoidance) to food pictures have been reported in patients with eating disorders. The study’s aim was to examine the vigilance-avoidance hypothesis concerning food information processing by unraveling the time course of attention deployment in individuals with AN.
Methods: We used eye-tracking to examine continuous attention deployment in 19 individuals with AN during free visual exploration of food pictures versus nonfood pictures compared with 18 fasted and 20 nonfasted healthy control subjects.
Results: Compared with healthy control subjects, AN patients allocated overall less attention to food pictures but showed no early attentional bias toward food pictures. Attentional engagement for food pictures was most pronounced in fasted healthy control subjects. The extent of attention deployment in AN patients was associated with indicators of the disorder’s severity.
Conclusions: Gaze data suggest that individuals with AN show no early vigilance but later avoidance when confronted with food information. This suggests that initially, AN patients perceive incentive salience from food information because they process food pictures in the same way healthy control subjects do. The time course of attention deployment suggests that it is only after a ﬁrst phase of stimulus encoding and labeling as food that individuals with AN avoid food pictures. This pattern of attention deployment is probably mediated by disorder-speciﬁc dysfunctional cognitions.},

However, the reported effects of these compounds on child behavior, cognitive and psychomotor outcomes are not fully consistent. The aim of this study is to evaluate the associations between prenatal and early postnatal phthalate exposures and child neurodevelopment at age of 7 years. A total of 134 mother-child pairs from Polish Mother and Child Cohort (REPRO\_PL) constitute the basis for current analysis. Eleven phthalate metabolites were measured in urine samples collected from mothers in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and from children at the age of 2 years. Child neuropsychological development at early school age (7 years) was assessed by both the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) filled by mothers and the Polish adaptation of the Intelligence and Development Scales (IDS) performed by psychologists. Mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) concentration during pregnancy was significantly associated with increased risk of peer relationship problems in SDQ (OR = 2.7, p = 0.03). The results of the IDS analyses focused on child's cognitive and psychomotor development are not fully conclusive. Negative associations were evident between some phthalates in early childhood period and fluid intelligence and cognition (MEP: β = −5.2; p = 0.006; β = −4.2; p = 0.006; mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP): β = −4.9; p = 0.03; β = −4.0; p = 0.03; respectively), while positive associations have been found in the prenatal period (mono-2-ethyl-5-oxo-hexyl phthalate (oxo-MEHP): β = 3.6; p = 0.03 for fluid intelligence; β = 2.9; p = 0.03 for cognition). Further studies are required in order to elucidate which are the most critical periods of phthalate exposure on children's neurodevelopmental outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background—Brain sex differences are found in nearly every region of the brain and fundamental to sexually dimorphic behaviors as well as disorders of the brain and behavior. These differences are organized during gestation and early adolescence and detectable prior to puberty. Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) interfere with hormone action and are thus prenatal exposure is hypothesized to disrupt the formation of sex differences, and contribute to the increased prevalence of pediatric neuropsychiatric disorders that present with a sex bias.
Objective—Available evidence for the ability of EDCs to impact the emergence of brain sex differences in the rodent brain was reviewed here, with a focus on effects detected at or before puberty.
Methods—The peer-reviewed literature was searched using PubMed, and all relevant papers published by January 31, 2015 were incorporated. Endpoints of interest included molecular cellular and neuroanatomical effects. Studies on behavioral endpoints were not included because numerous reviews of that literature are available.
Results—The hypothalamus was found to be particularly affected by estrogenic EDCs in a sex, time, and exposure dependent manner. The hippocampus also appears vulnerable to endocrine disruption by BPA and PCBs although there is little evidence from the pre-pubertal literature to make any conclusions about sex-specific effects. Gestational EDC exposure can alter fetal neurogenesis and gene expression throughout the brain including the cortex and cerebellum. The available literature primarily focuses on a few, well characterized EDCs, but little data is available for emerging contaminants.
Conclusion—The developmental EDC exposure literature demonstrates evidence of altered neurodevelopment as early as fetal life, with sex specific effects observed throughout the brain even before puberty.},

Objectives: To assess cumulative associations between prenatal phthalate mixtures and child behaviors, including effect modification by exposure timing and child sex.
Methods: Analyses included 501 mother/child pairs from the multicenter pregnancy cohort The Infant Devel­ opment and Environment Study (TIDES). Nine maternal urinary phthalate metabolites were measured in early and late pregnancy, and behavior was assessed at ages 4–5 years using composite T scores for the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC-2), which measures several dimensions of child behavior, and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2), which measures social impairment consistent with autistic traits. We utilized weighted quantile sum (WQS) regressions to examine pregnancy period-specific associations between phthalate mixtures and behavioral outcomes. Full-sample 95\% WQS confidence intervals are known to be anticonservative, so we calculated a confirmatory p-value using a permutation test. Effect modification by sex was examined with stratified analyses.
Results: A one-quintile increase in the early pregnancy phthalate mixture was associated with increased SRS-2 total score (coefficient = 1.0, confirmatory p = 0.01) and worse adaptive skills (coefficient = − 1.0, confirma­ tory p = 0.06) in both sexes. In sex-stratified analyses, the early pregnancy phthalate mixture was associated with increased SRS-2 total score in boys (coefficient = 1.2, confirmatory p = 0.04) and girls (coefficient = 1.0, confirmatory p = 0.10) and worse BASC-2 adaptive skills score in girls (coefficient = − 1.5, confirmatory p = 0.06), while the late pregnancy phthalate mixture was associated with increased BASC-2 externalizing score in boys (coefficient = 1.3, confirmatory p = 0.03).
Conclusion: Our results suggest cumulative adverse associations between prenatal phthalate mixtures and mul­ tiple facets of childhood behavior.},

            Multimodal exploration of objects during toy play is important for a child’s development and is suggested to be abnormal in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) due to either atypical attention or atypical action. However, little is known about how children with ASD coordinate their visual attention and manual actions during toy play. The current study aims to understand if and in what ways children with ASD generate exploratory behaviors to toys in natural, unconstrained contexts by utilizing head-mounted eye tracking to quantify moment-by-moment attention. We found no differences in how 24- to 48-mo children with and without ASD distribute their visual attention, generate manual action, or coordinate their visual and manual behaviors during toy play with a parent. Our findings suggest an intact ability and willingness of children with ASD to explore toys and suggest that context is important when studying child behavior.},

The proposed model is useful for situations where the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher’s information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented and discussed.},

Methods: In a follow up of 328 inner-city mothers and their children, we measured prenatal urinary metabolites of di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP), di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate in late pregnancy. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition was administered at child age 7 years and evaluates four areas of cognitive function associated with overall intelligence quotient (IQ). Results: Child full-scale IQ was inversely associated with prenatal urinary metabolite concentrations of DnBP and DiBP: b522.69 (95\% confidence interval [CI]524.33, 21.05) and b522.69 (95\% CI524.22, 21.16) per log unit increase. Among children of mothers with the highest versus lowest quartile DnBP and DiBP metabolite concentrations, IQ was 6.7 (95\% CI51.9, 11.4) and 7.6 (95\% CI53.2, 12.1) points lower, respectively. Associations were unchanged after control for cognition at age 3 years. Significant inverse associations were also seen between maternal prenatal metabolite concentrations of DnBP and DiBP and child processing speed, perceptual reasoning and working memory; DiBP and child verbal comprehension; and BBzP and child perceptual reasoning.},

	abstract = {Objective—This study investigates the association between urinary phthalate metabolite levels and attention deficit disorder (ADD), learning disability (LD), and co-occurrence of ADD and LD in 6–15-year-old children.
Methods—We used cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2001–2004). Phthalate metabolites with ≥ 75\% detection in urine samples were examined. The study population comprised 1493 children with parent-reported information on ADD or LD diagnosis and phthalate concentrations in urine. Phthalate concentrations were creatinine-adjusted and log10-transformed for analysis. All models controlled for child sex, age, race, household income, blood lead, and maternal smoking during pregnancy.
Results—There were 112 ADD cases, 173 LD cases, and 56 ADD and LD cases in the sample. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found increased odds of ADD with increasing urinary concentration of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalates (OR: 2.1; 95\% CI: 1.1, 3.9) and high molecular weight phthalates (OR: 2.7; 95\% CI: 1.2, 6.1). In addition, dibutyl phthalates (OR: 3.3; 95\% CI: 0.9, 12.7) and high molecular weight phthalates (OR: 3.7; 95\% CI: 0.9, 14.8) were marginally associated with increased odds of co-occurring ADD and LD. We did not find associations for any phthalate and LD alone. We observed stronger associations between phthalates and ADD and both ADD and LD in girls than boys in some models.
Conclusions—We found cross-sectional evidence that certain phthalates are associated with increased odds of ADD and both ADD and LD. Further investigations with longitudinal data are needed to confirm these results.},

	abstract = {Background: Few studies have shown an association between prenatal phthalate exposure and adverse effects on neurodevelopment and behavior in young children.
Objectives: We aimed to assess the relationship between prenatal exposure to phthalate esters and behavior syndromes in children at 8 years of age.
Methods: A total of 122 mother–child pairs from the general population in central Taiwan were studied from 2000 to 2009. Mono-methyl phthalate (MMP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), monobutyl phthalate (MBP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), and three di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites—mono-2-ethylhexyl, mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl, and mono-2-ethyl-5oxohexyl phthalates (MEHP, MEHHP, and MEOHP)—were measured in maternal urine collected during the third trimester of pregnancy using liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry. Behavioral syndromes of children at 8 years of age were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Associations between log10-transformed creatinine-corrected phthalate concentrations and standardized scores of the CBCL were estimated using linear regression models or multinomial logistic regressions with adjustments for potential confounders.
Results: Externalizing problem scores were significantly higher in association with a 1-unit increase in log10-transformed creatinine-corrected concentrations of maternal MBP (β = 4.29; 95\% CI: 0.59, 7.99), MEOHP (β = 3.74; 95\% CI: 1.33, 6.15), and MEHP (β = 4.28 ; 95\% CI: 0.03, 8.26) after adjusting for the child’s sex, intelligence, and family income. Meanwhile, MBP and MEOHP were significantly associated with Delinquent Behavior and Aggressive Behavior scores. The same pattern was found for borderline and/or clinical ranges.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest positive associations between maternal DEHP and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) exposure and externalizing domain behavior problems in 8-year-old children.

	abstract = {Background: There is concern over potential neurobehavioral effects of prenatal phthalate exposures, but available data are inconsistent.
Objectives: We examined associations between prenatal urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites and neurobehavioral scores among children.
Methods: We measured phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine samples from 153 pregnant participants in the Study for Future Families, a multicenter cohort study. Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist when the children were 6–10 years of age. We estimated overall and sexspecific associations between phthalate concentrations and behavior using adjusted multiple regression interaction models.
Results: In boys, concentrations of monoisobutyl phthalate were associated with higher scores for inattention (β = 0.27; 95\% CI: 0.04, 0.50), rule-breaking behavior (β = 0.20; 95\% CI: 0.01, 0.38), aggression (β = 0.34; 95\% CI: 0.09, 0.59), and conduct problems (β = 0.39; 95\% CI: 0.20, 0.58), whereas the molar sum of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites was associated with higher scores for somatic problems (β = 0.15; 95\% CI: 0.03, 0.28). Higher monobenzyl phthalate concentrations were associated with higher scores for oppositional behavior (β = 0.16; 95\% CI: 0.01, 0.32) and conduct problems (β = 0.21; 95\% CI: 0.06, 0.37) in boys, but with reduced anxiety scores in girls (β = –0.20; 95\% CI: –0.39, –0.01). In general, the associations reported above were close to the null among girls. Model coefficients represent the difference in the square root–transformed outcome score associated with a 1-unit increase in log-transformed metabolites.
Conclusions: Our results suggest associations between exposure to certain phthalates in late pregnancy and behavioral problems in boys. Given the few studies on this topic and methodological and population differences among studies, additional research is warranted.},

	abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk of childhood diseases by disrupting hormonally mediated processes critical for growth and development during gestation, infancy, or childhood. The fetus, infant, and child may have enhanced sensitivity to environmental stressors like EDCs due to rapid development and greater exposure to some EDCs that results from their developmentally appropriate behavior, anatomy, and physiology. This review summarizes epidemiological studies examining the relations of early-life exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, triclosan, and perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) with childhood neurobehavioral disorders and obesity. The available epidemiological evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to several of these ubiquitous EDCs is associated with adverse neurobehavior (BPA and phthalates) and excess adiposity or increased risk of obesity/overweight (PFAS). Quantifying the effects of EDC mixtures, improving EDC exposure assessment, reducing bias from confounding, identifying periods of heightened vulnerability, and elucidating the presence and nature of sexually dimorphic EDC effects would result in stronger inferences from epidemiological studies. Ultimately, better estimates of the causal effects of EDC exposures on child health could help identify susceptible sub-populations and lead to public health interventions to reduce these exposures.},

	abstract = {Background: Exposure to environmental phenols including parabens, bisphenols (BPs), oxybenzone/benzophenone-3 (BP-3) and triclosan (TCS) is ubiquitous. Due to evidence of their estrogenic activity, they have been considered as chemicals of concern. The exposure of the Norwegian population to these compounds is presently unknown. Aims: To measure urinary levels of twelve diﬀerent environmental phenols including four emerging bisphenols: S, F, B and AF (abbreviated as BPS, BPF, BPB and BPAF, respectively) in a healthy Norwegian population. We have calculated short-term variability, estimated daily intakes and investigated important determinants of exposure.
Methods: Urine samples were collected from mothers (n = 48) and their children (n = 56) during spring/ summer 2012 in two counties in Norway.
Results: Six environmental phenols namely methyl, ethyl and propyl paraben, BPA, BP-3 and TCS were detected in almost 100\% of the urine samples. Among the emerging bisphenols, BPS was detected most frequently in the urine samples (42–48\%) followed by BPF (4–15\%). Parabens were positively and signiﬁcantly correlated to each other in both mothers and children. Levels of parabens and BP-3 were higher in mothers compared to children. All mothers and children had lower estimated daily intakes (back calculated from the urinary concentrations) of parabens and BPA than the respective acceptable and tolerable daily intakes (ADIs and TDIs) established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Observed intraclass correlation coeﬃcients (ICCs) indicated moderate to high reliability of spot urine measurements for all the environmental phenols (ICCs: 0.70–0.97). Use of hair products, deodorants, face and hand creams were signiﬁcantly associated with higher urinary levels of parabens.
Conclusions: Occurrence of environmental phenols in healthy Norwegian women and children is abundant. Among emerging bisphenols, there is widespread exposure to BPS. A single spot urine sample can be used for estimating short-term exposures of environmental phenols. Urinary levels of parabens were associated with use of PCPs.},

	abstract = {Gauging the robustness of regression estimates is especially important in small-sample analyses. Here, we examine recent developments in the detection and analysis of outliers and influential cases in multivariate studies. Specifically, we review five diagnostic procedures: partial regression plots, the “hat” matrix, studentized residuals, DFITS
              i
              , and DFBETAS
              ij
              . The main part of the article presents two empirical applications (drawn from recent cross-national studies) that show (a) how the diagnostic procedures can be incorporated into the research process, and (b) what we can learn from them. These applications serve to underscore the point that the diagnostics cannot be employed mechanically. Instead, once a case is diagnosed as influential, remedial action requires a firm substantive grounding. Although case deletion may be warranted in some circumstances, it is an extreme remedy of last resort that should not be routinely followed. The more fruitful approach is to ask why a given case is influential. As our applications indicate, the diagnostics can be helpful in isolating such problems as sample composition, specification error, and errors in measurement.},

	abstract = {The class of beta regression models is commonly used by practitioners to model variables that assume values in the standard unit interval (0, 1). It is based on the assumption that the dependent variable is beta-distributed and that its mean is related to a set of regressors through a linear predictor with unknown coeﬃcients and a link function. The model also includes a precision parameter which may be constant or depend on a (potentially diﬀerent) set of regressors through a link function as well. This approach naturally incorporates features such as heteroskedasticity or skewness which are commonly observed in data taking values in the standard unit interval, such as rates or proportions. This paper describes the betareg package which provides the class of beta regressions in the R system for statistical computing. The underlying theory is brieﬂy outlined, the implementation discussed and illustrated in various replication exercises.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The etiology of autism spectrum disorder is poorly understood. Few studies have investigated the link between endocrine-disrupting chemicals and autistic traits. We examined the relationship between gestational phthalates and autistic traits in 3- to 4-y-old Canadian children. We also investigated potential eﬀect modiﬁcation by sex and folic acid supplementation.
METHODS: We enrolled 2,001 women {\textgreater}18 years of age during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy between 2008 and 2011 from 10 cities in Canada. At 3–4 years of age, 610 children underwent neuropsychological assessments including the Social Responsiveness Scale–II (SRS-2) as a measure of autistic traits and social impairment. We measured 11 phthalate metabolites in maternal ﬁrst trimester urine samples and assessed folic acid supplementation from reported intakes. We estimated covariate-adjusted diﬀerences in SRS-2 T-scores with a doubling in phthalate concentrations in 510 children with complete data.
RESULTS: Mean total SRS T-score was 45.3 (SD = 6:1). Children with higher gestational exposure to mono-n-butyl (MBP) and mono-3carboxypropyl (MCPP) concentrations exhibited signiﬁcantly higher total SRS T-scores, indicating greater overall social impairment, as well as higher scores on subdomains, indicating deﬁcits in social cognition, social communication, social motivation, and restricted interests/repetitive behaviors. A doubling in MBP or MCPP concentrations was associated with 0.6 (95\% CI: 0.1, 1.0) and 0.5 (95\% CI: 0.1, 0.8) higher total SRS T-scores. Associations were consistently and signiﬁcantly stronger in boys (bMBP = 1:0; 95\% CI: 0.4, 1.6; n = 252) compared with girls (bMBP = 0:1; 95\% CI: −0:6, 0.7; n = 258) and among children who had lower prenatal folic acid supplementation ({\textless}400 lg=d) (bMBP = 1:3; 95\% CI: 0.4, 2.3; n = 59) compared with those who had adequate folic acid supplementation (≥400 lg=d) (bMBP = 0:4; 95\% CI: −0:1, 0.8; n = 451).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher gestational concentrations of some phthalate metabolites were associated with higher scores of autistic traits as measured by the SRS-2 in boys, but not girls; these small size eﬀects were mitigated by ﬁrst trimester-of-pregnancy folic acid supplementation. https://doi.org/ 10.1289/EHP5621},

Objectives: To evaluate the specific associations of prenatal phthalate exposures with ASD symptoms in children (ages 3–6) accounting for other behavior problems, and to assess sex differences in these associations.
Methods: We measured phthalate metabolites in prenatal urine samples. Mothers completed the Social Respon­ siveness Scale-2nd edition (SRS-2) to assess child ASD symptoms and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess general behavior problems. We assessed associations of the sum of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites, monobutyl phthalate, mono-isobutyl phthalate, and monoethyl phthalate (mEP) with ASD symptoms, adjusting for other behavior problems, using linear regression models (n=77).
Results: Most associations were null, and the sample size limited power to detect associations, particularly in the stratified analyses. After adjusting for internalizing and externalizing problems from the CBCL, ASD symptoms increased for each doubling of prenatal mEP concentration among boys only.
Conclusions: Further investigation of maternal prenatal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and ASD symptoms while adjusting for other behavioral problems is warranted.},

However, the potential effect of chemicals may be greater among individuals at the ‘tails’ of outcome distributions. Here, we investigated distributional effects on the associations between gestational phthalate exposure and child Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)-related behaviors using quantile regression. We harmonized data from the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) (n = 140) Study, an enriched-risk cohort of mothers who had a child with ASD, and the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study (n = 276), a general population cohort. We measured concentrations of 9 phthalate metabolites in urine samples collected twice during pregnancy. Caregivers reported children’s ASD-related behaviors using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) at age 3–8 years; higher scores indicate more ASD-related behaviors. In EARLI, associations between phthalate concentrations and SRS scores were predominately inverse or null across SRS score quantiles. In HOME, positive associations of mono-n-butyl phthalate, monobenzyl phthalate, mono-isobutyl phthalate, and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate concentrations with SRS scores increased in strength from the median to 95th percentile of SRS scores. These results suggest associations between phthalate concentrations and SRS scores may be stronger in individuals with higher SRS scores.},

	abstract = {Background: Evidence from experimental and observational studies suggests that prenatal phthalate exposures may be associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We examined whether prenatal phthalate exposures were associated with an increased risk of ASD.
Methods: We quantified 14 metabolites of eight phthalates in 636 multiple maternal urine samples collected during 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy from 201 mother-child pairs in MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies – Learning Early Signs), a high-risk ASD longitudinal cohort. At 3 years old, children were clinically assessed for ASD and classified into three diagnostic categories: ASD (n = 46), non-typical development (Non-TD, n = 55), and typical development (TD, n = 100). We used multinomial logistic regression to evaluate the association of phthalate metabolite concentrations with ASD and Non-TD.
Results: Most associations of phthalate biomarkers with both ASD and Non-TD were null, with the exception that monoethyl phthalate (MEP) was significantly associated with an increased risk of Non-TD (per 2.72-fold relative increase in concentration: Relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.38; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.90). When stratified by prenatal vitamin use during the first month of pregnancy, among mothers who took vitamins, ASD risk was inversely associated with mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP, RRR = 0.44; 95\% CI: 0.21, 0.88), mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP, RRR = 0.41; 95\% CI: 0.20, 0.83) and mono-carboxyisooctyl phthalate (MCOP, RRR = 0.49; 95\% CI: 0.27, 0.88), but among mothers who did not take prenatal vitamins, Non-TD risk was positively associated with MCPP (RRR = 5.09; 95\% CI: 2.05, 12.6), MCOP (RRR = 1.86; 95\% CI: 1.01, 3.39), and mono-carboxyisononyl phthalate (MCNP, RRR = 3.67; 95\% CI: 1.80, 7.48). When stratified by sex, among boys, MEP, monobenzyl phthalate, MCPP, MCNP, and sum of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (ΣDEHP) were positively associated with Non-TD risk, but associations with ASD were null. Among girls, associations with both ASD and Non-TD were null.
Conclusions: Our study showed that phthalate exposures in mid- to late pregnancy were not associated with ASD in children from this high-risk ASD cohort. Further studies should be conducted in the general population without high-risk genes to confirm our findings.},

	abstract = {Prenatal phthalate exposure has been linked to altered neurobehavioral development in both animal models and epidemiologic studies, but whether or not these associations translate to increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders is unclear. We used a nested case-cohort study design to assess whether maternal urinary concentrations of 12 phthalate metabolites at 17 weeks gestation were associated with criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) classified among 3-year-old children in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Between 2007 and 2011, 260 children in this substudy were classified with ADHD using a standardized, on-site clinical assessment; they were compared with 549 population-based controls. We modeled phthalate levels both linearly and by quintiles in logistic regression models adjusted for relevant covariates and tested for interaction by child sex. Children of mothers in the highest quintile of di-iso-nonyl phthalate (∑DiNP) metabolite levels had 1.70 times the odds of being classified with ADHD compared with those in the lowest quintile (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03 to 2.82). In linear models, there was a trend with the sum of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites (∑DEHP); each natural log-unit increase in concentration was associated with 1.22 times the odds of ADHD (95\% CI = 0.99 to 1.52). In boys, but not girls, mono-n-butyl phthalate exposure was associated with increased odds of ADHD (odds ratio [OR] 1.42; 95\% CI = 1.07 to 1.88). Additional adjustment for correlated phthalate metabolites attenuated estimates. These results suggest gestational phthalate exposure may impact the behavior of children as young as 3 years.},

	abstract = {Phthalates (dialkyl or alkyl phenyl esters of phthalic acid, benzene-1.2-dicarboxylic acid) are a group of industrial chemicals that have been used for more than 50 years. Phthalates are ubiquitous and can potentially have adverse effects on humans. The present study presents an accurate, sensitive and automated analytical method for measuring 12 phthalate metabolites (free and conjugated) in human urine using on-line solid phase extraction coupled to high performance liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization - tandem mass spectrometry. A small volume of urine sample (300μL) is required. Glucoronidated phthalate metabolites are deconjugated by incubation with glucoronidase enzyme (Escherihia coli-K 12) and the reaction is stopped by adding formic acid. This is the only sample preparation needed prior to injection into the column switching system. Thus, the method involves minimal sample handling and minimizes possible contaminations from the surroundings. The method was validated by spiking synthetic urine at 5-8 levels in the range of 0.1-500ng phthalate metabolites/mL synthetic urine. The method is sensitive with limits of detection in the low nanogram range, and rapid with a total run time about 25min. The accuracy was between 90 and 120 \% and the intermediate precision was given as relative standard deviation was below 20\% for most of the compounds. The high sensitivity, high throughput and minimal manual handling make the method suitable for large-scale biomonitoring studies. The present method was applied for the determination of phthalate metabolites in urine samples from 116 pregnant women, a subproject within the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Concentrations of all the twelve phthalate metabolites was {\textgreater}LOQ in 100\% of the samples analysed. Mean urinary concentrations for different phthalate metabolites ranged from 1 to 100ng/mL, the highest concentrations were observed for di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites and lowest for di-iso-nonyl phthalate (DiNP) metabolites. The urinary concentrations for most of the phthalate metabolites in the present study were found to be in the same range as found in other studies of pregnant women.},

	abstract = {Long before infants reach, crawl or walk, they explore the world by looking: they look to learn and to engage, giving preferential attention to social stimuli, including faces, face-like stimuli and biological motion. This capacity-social visual engagement-shapes typical infant development from birth and is pathognomonically impaired in children affected by autism. Here we show that variation in viewing of social scenes, including levels of preferential attention and the timing, direction and targeting of individual eye movements, is strongly influenced by genetic factors, with effects directly traceable to the active seeking of social information. In a series of eye-tracking experiments conducted with 338 toddlers, including 166 epidemiologically ascertained twins (enrolled by representative sampling from the general population), 88 non-twins with autism and 84 singleton controls, we find high monozygotic twin-twin concordance (0.91) and relatively low dizygotic concordance (0.35). Moreover, the characteristics that are the most highly heritable, preferential attention to eye and mouth regions of the face, are also those that are differentially decreased in children with autism (χ2 = 64.03, P {\textless} 0.0001). These results implicate social visual engagement as a neurodevelopmental endophenotype not only for autism, but also for population-wide variation in social-information seeking. In addition, these results reveal a means of human biological niche construction, with phenotypic differences emerging from the interaction of individual genotypes with early life experience.},

	abstract = {Typically, developing humans innately place subjective value on social information and orient attention to it. This can be shown through tracking of gaze patterns and pupil size, the latter of which taps into an individual’s cognitive engagement and aﬀective arousal. People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) present with atypical social, communicative and behavioral patterns, but underlying substrates of these behavioral diﬀerences remain unclear. Moreover, due to high comorbidity with other neurodevelopmental disorders, it is often diﬃcult to distinguish which diﬀerences are distinctive to ASD. In this study, a group of 35 adolescents and young adults with neurodevelopmental disorders were tested to investigate the processing of social and non-social scenes in individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria for autism and those who do not. Eye tracking and pupillometry measures were collected while participants observed images of tightly controlled natural scenes with or without a human being. Contrary to individuals without autism diagnosis, participants with autism did not show greater pupillary response to images with a human. Participants with autism were slower to ﬁxate on social elements in the social scenes, and this latency metric correlated with clinical measures of poor social functioning. The results conﬁrm the clinical relevance of eye-tracking and pupillometric indices in the ﬁeld of ASD. We discuss the clinical implications of the results and propose that analysis of changes in visual attention and physiological level to social stimuli might be an integral part of a neurodevelopmental assessment.},

Among others, two algorithms are mainly implemented: Expectation Maximization (EM) and Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). They have been shown to work well in large samples or when only small proportions of missing data are to be imputed. However, some researchers have begun to impute large proportions of missing data or to apply the method to small samples. A simulation was performed using MICE on datasets with 50, 100 or 200 cases and four or eleven variables. A varying proportion of data (3\% - 63\%) was set as missing completely at random and subsequently substituted using multiple imputation by chained equations. In a logistic regression model, four coefficients, i.e. non-zero and zero main effects as well as non-zero and zero interaction effects were examined. Estimations of all main and interaction effects were unbiased. There was a considerable variance in the estimates, increasing with the proportion of missing data and decreasing with sample size. The imputation of missing data by chained equations is a useful tool for imputing small to moderate proportions of missing data. The method has its limits, however. In small samples, there are considerable random errors for all effects.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12874-020-01018-7},
	abstract = {Background: Missing data in covariates can result in biased estimates and loss of power to detect associations. It can also lead to other challenges in time-to-event analyses including the handling of time-varying effects of covariates, selection of covariates and their flexible modelling. This review aims to describe how researchers approach time-to-event analyses with missing data.
Methods: Medline and Embase were searched for observational time-to-event studies in oncology published from January 2012 to January 2018. The review focused on proportional hazards models or extended Cox models. We investigated the extent and reporting of missing data and how it was addressed in the analysis. Covariate modelling and selection, and assessment of the proportional hazards assumption were also investigated, alongside the treatment of missing data in these procedures.
Results: 148 studies were included. The mean proportion of individuals with missingness in any covariate was 32\%. 53\% of studies used complete-case analysis, and 22\% used multiple imputation. In total, 14\% of studies stated an assumption concerning missing data and only 34\% stated missingness as a limitation. The proportional hazards assumption was checked in 28\% of studies, of which, 17\% did not state the assessment method. 58\% of 144 multivariable models stated their covariate selection procedure with use of a pre-selected set of covariates being the most popular followed by stepwise methods and univariable analyses. Of 69 studies that included continuous covariates, 81\% did not assess the appropriateness of the functional form.
Conclusion: While guidelines for handling missing data in epidemiological studies are in place, this review indicates that few report implementing recommendations in practice. Although missing data are present in many studies, we found that few state clearly how they handled it or the assumptions they have made. Easy-to-implement but potentially biased approaches such as complete-case analysis are most commonly used despite these relying on strong assumptions and where often more appropriate methods should be employed. Authors should be encouraged to follow existing guidelines to address missing data, and increased levels of expectation from journals and editors could be used to improve practice.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Researchers are concerned whether multiple imputation (MI) or complete case analysis should be used when a large proportion of data are missing. We aimed to provide guidance for drawing conclusions from data with a large proportion of missingness. Study Design and Setting: Via simulations, we investigated how the proportion of missing data, the fraction of missing information (FMI), and availability of auxiliary variables affected MI performance. Outcome data were missing completely at random or missing at random (MAR).
Results: Provided sufﬁcient auxiliary information was available; MI was beneﬁcial in terms of bias and never detrimental in terms of efﬁciency. Models with similar FMI values, but differing proportions of missing data, also had similar precision for effect estimates. In the absence of bias, the FMI was a better guide to the efﬁciency gains using MI than the proportion of missing data.
Conclusion: We provide evidence that for MAR data, valid MI reduces bias even when the proportion of missingness is large. We advise researchers to use FMI to guide choice of auxiliary variables for efﬁciency gain in imputation analyses, and that sensitivity analyses including different imputation models may be needed if the number of complete cases is small.

	abstract = {Background: Missing data may seriously compromise inferences from randomised clinical trials, especially if missing data are not handled appropriately. The potential bias due to missing data depends on the mechanism causing the data to be missing, and the analytical methods applied to amend the missingness. Therefore, the analysis of trial data with missing values requires careful planning and attention.
Methods: The authors had several meetings and discussions considering optimal ways of handling missing data to minimise the bias potential. We also searched PubMed (key words: missing data; randomi*; statistical analysis) and reference lists of known studies for papers (theoretical papers; empirical studies; simulation studies; etc.) on how to deal with missing data when analysing randomised clinical trials.
Results: Handling missing data is an important, yet difficult and complex task when analysing results of randomised clinical trials. We consider how to optimise the handling of missing data during the planning stage of a randomised clinical trial and recommend analytical approaches which may prevent bias caused by unavoidable missing data. We consider the strengths and limitations of using of best-worst and worst-best sensitivity analyses, multiple imputation, and full information maximum likelihood. We also present practical flowcharts on how to deal with missing data and an overview of the steps that always need to be considered during the analysis stage of a trial.
Conclusions: We present a practical guide and flowcharts describing when and how multiple imputation should be used to handle missing data in randomised clinical.},

Using this property of logistic regression, we propose new methods of determining the sample size for simple and multiple logistic regressions using a normal transformation of outcome measures.

	abstract = {Over 1.3 million civilian and military personnel are occupationally exposed to hydrocarbon fuels, emphasizing gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, or kerosene. These exposures may occur acutely or chronically to raw fuel, vapor, aerosol, or fuel combustion exhaust by dermal, respiratory inhalation, or oral ingestion routes, and commonly occur concurrently with exposure to other chemicals and stressors. Hydrocarbon fuels are complex mixtures of 150-260+ aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds containing varying concentrations of potential neurotoxicants including benzene, n-hexane, toluene, xylenes, naphthalene, and certain n-C9-C12 fractions (n-propylbenzene, trimethylbenzene isomers). Due to their natural petroleum base, the chemical composition of different hydrocarbon fuels is not defined, and the fuels are classified according to broad performance criteria such as flash and boiling points, complicating toxicological comparisons. While hydrocarbon fuel exposures occur typically at concentrations below permissible exposure limits for their constituent chemicals, it is unknown whether additive or synergistic interactions may result in unpredicted neurotoxicity. The inclusion of up to six performance additives in existing fuel formulations presents additional neurotoxicity challenge. Additionally, exposures to hydrocarbon fuels, typically with minimal respiratory or dermal protection, range from weekly fueling of personal automobiles to waist-deep immersion of personnel in raw fuel during maintenance of aircraft fuel tanks. Occupational exposures may occur on a near daily basis for from several months to over 20 yr. A number of published studies have reported acute or persisting neurotoxic effects from acute, subchronic, or chronic exposure of humans or animals to hydrocarbon fuels, or to certain constituent chemicals of these fuels. This review summarizes human and animal studies of hydrocarbon fuel-induced neurotoxicity and neurobehavioral consequences. It is hoped that this review will support ongoing attempts to review and possibly revise exposure standards for hydrocarbon fuels.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, several hundred million tons of organic solvents are used annually in household, industry, and other occupational settings. Millions of workers are regularly exposed to organic solvents considered neurotoxic. Acute neurotoxicity due to high exposure of solvent is usually evident, but the nature of long-term effects, such as chronic solvent encephalopathy (CSE), has raised uncertainty even among experts. Earlier studies were criticized for their methodology, mainly epidemiologic studies or investigations of exposed groups with many possible confounders and inadequate exposure assessment. However, an increasing number of studies have been performed since, also on workers with defined CSE based on differential diagnostics. During the last decade, evidence has emerged to enable identification of CSE, a necessity for the early recognition and prevention of progression of dysfunction and disability. Selected chemicals are presented here due to their widespread use, neurotoxic potential, and ability to cause solvent encephalopathy. Constant introduction of new chemicals may introduce new hazardous chemicals or known chemicals may reveal new health effects. It is important to keep an open mind for new findings of solvent-related neurobehavioral effects.},

Most pesticides are not highly selective, and are also toxic to nontarget species, including humans. A number of pesticides can cause neurotoxicity. Insecticides, which kill insects by targeting their nervous system, have neurotoxic effect in mammals as well. This family of chemicals comprises the organophosphates, the carbamates, the pyrethroids, the organochlorines, and other compounds. Insecticides interfere with chemical neurotransmission or ion channels, and usually cause reversible neurotoxic effects, that could nevertheless be lethal. Some herbicides and fungicides have also been shown to possess neurotoxic properties. The effects of pesticides on the nervous system may be involved in their acute toxicity, as in case of most insecticides, or may contribute to chronic neurodegenerative disorders, most notably Parkinson's disease. This brief review highlights some of the main neurotoxic pesticides, their effects, and mechanisms of action.},

	abstract = {Several pesticides such as organophosphates, carbamates and the organochlorine pesticides directly target nervous tissue as their mechanism of toxicity. In several others, such as the fumigants, the nervous system is affected by toxicological mechanisms that diffusely affect most or all tissues in the body. Both the central and peripheral nervous system are involved in the acute toxidromes of many pesticides resulting in acute short-term effects. There is strong human epidemiological evidence for persistent nervous system damage following acute intoxication with several important pesticide groups such as organophosphates and certain fumigants. However, whether persistent nervous system damage follows chronic low-level exposure to pesticides in adults (particularly organophosphpates), and whether in utero and/or early childhood exposure leads to persistent nervous system damage, is a subject of study at present. Parkinson's Disease, one of the most common chronic central nervous system diseases, has been linked to pesticide exposure in some studies, but other studies have failed to find an association. Several new pesticidal chemicals such as the neo-nicotinoids and fipronil have central nervous system effects, but only case reports are available to date on acute human intoxications with several of these. Little data are yet available on whether long-term effects result from these chemicals. Several ongoing or recently completed studies should add valuable insight into the effects of pesticides on the human nervous system particularly the effect of low-dose, chronic exposure both in adults and children.},

	abstract = {In a prospective cohort study of 249 children from birth to two years of age, we assessed the relation between prenatal and postnatal lead exposure and early cognitive development. On the basis of lead levels in umbilical-cord blood, children were assigned to one of three prenatal-exposure groups: low (less than 3 micrograms per deciliter), medium (6 to 7 micrograms per deciliter), or high (greater than or equal to 10 micrograms per deciliter). Development was assessed semiannually, beginning at the age of six months, with use of the Mental Development Index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (mean +/- SD, 100 +/- 16). Capillary-blood samples obtained at the same times provided measures of postnatal lead exposure. Regression methods for longitudinal data were used to evaluate the association between infants' lead levels and their development scores after adjustment for potential confounders. At all ages, infants in the high-prenatal-exposure group scored lower than infants in the other two groups. The estimated difference between the overall performance of the low-exposure and high-exposure groups was 4.8 points (95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 7.3). Between the medium- and high-exposure groups, the estimated difference was 3.8 points (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 6.3). Scores were not related to infants' postnatal blood lead levels. It appears that the fetus may be adversely affected at blood lead concentrations well below 25 micrograms per deciliter, the level currently defined by the Centers for Disease Control as the highest acceptable level for young children.},

In the last decades, much progress has been achieved in understanding the effects of the drugs of abuse in the brain. However, efficient treatments that prevent relapse have not been developed. Drug addiction is now considered a brain disease, because the abuse of drugs affects several brain functions. Neurological impairments observed in drug addicts may reflect drug-induced neuronal dysfunction and neurotoxicity. The drugs of abuse directly or indirectly affect neurotransmitter systems, particularly dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurons. This review explores the literature reporting cellular and molecular alterations reflecting the cytotoxicity induced by amphetamines, cocaine and opiates in neuronal systems. The neurotoxic effects of drugs of abuse are often associated with oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis and inhibition of neurogenesis, among other mechanisms. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie brain dysfunction observed in drug-addicted individuals may contribute to improve the treatment of drug addiction, which may have social and economic consequences.},

A major concern is developmental neurotoxicity, although impacts on neurodegenerative outcomes have also been noted. Here, we review human studies of prenatal and adult exposures to PCBs and describe the state of knowledge regarding outcomes across domains related to cognition (e.g., IQ, language, memory, learning), attention, behavioral regulation and executive function, and social behavior, including traits related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We also review current understanding of molecular mechanisms underpinning these associations, with a focus on dopaminergic neurotransmission, thyroid hormone disruption, calcium dyshomeostasis, and oxidative stress. Finally, we briefly consider contemporary sources of organohalogens that may pose human health risks via mechanisms of neurotoxicity common to those ascribed to PCBs.},

	issn = {1545-8636},
	abstract = {PROBLEM/CONDITION: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of developmental disabilities characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication and by restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior. Symptoms typically are apparent before age 3 years. The complex nature of these disorders, coupled with a lack of biologic markers for diagnosis and changes in clinical definitions over time, creates challenges in monitoring the prevalence of ASDs. Accurate reporting of data is essential to understand the prevalence of ASDs in the population and can help direct research.
PERIOD COVERED: 2008.
DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network is an active surveillance system that estimates the prevalence of ASDs and describes other characteristics among children aged 8 years whose parents or guardians reside within 14 ADDM sites in the United States. ADDM does not rely on professional or family reporting of an existing ASD diagnosis or classification to ascertain case status. Instead, information is obtained from children's evaluation records to determine the presence of ASD symptoms at any time from birth through the end of the year when the child reaches age 8 years. ADDM focuses on children aged 8 years because a baseline study conducted by CDC demonstrated that this is the age of identified peak prevalence. A child is included as meeting the surveillance case definition for an ASD if he or she displays behaviors (as described on a comprehensive evaluation completed by a qualified professional) consistent with the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for any of the following conditions: Autistic Disorder; Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS, including Atypical Autism); or Asperger Disorder. The first phase of the ADDM methodology involves screening and abstraction of comprehensive evaluations completed by professional providers at multiple data sources in the community. Multiple data sources are included, ranging from general pediatric health clinics to specialized programs for children with developmental disabilities. In addition, many ADDM sites also review and abstract records of children receiving special education services in public schools. In the second phase of the study, all abstracted evaluations are reviewed by trained clinicians to determine ASD case status. Because the case definition and surveillance methods have remained consistent across all ADDM surveillance years to date, comparisons to results for earlier surveillance years can be made. This report provides updated ASD prevalence estimates from the 2008 surveillance year, representing 14 ADDM areas in the United States. In addition to prevalence estimates, characteristics of the population of children with ASDs are described, as well as detailed comparisons of the 2008 surveillance year findings with those for the 2002 and 2006 surveillance years.
RESULTS: For 2008, the overall estimated prevalence of ASDs among the 14 ADDM sites was 11.3 per 1,000 (one in 88) children aged 8 years who were living in these communities during 2008. Overall ASD prevalence estimates varied widely across all sites (range: 4.8-21.2 per 1,000 children aged 8 years). ASD prevalence estimates also varied widely by sex and by racial/ethnic group. Approximately one in 54 boys and one in 252 girls living in the ADDM Network communities were identified as having ASDs. Comparison of 2008 findings with those for earlier surveillance years indicated an increase in estimated ASD prevalence of 23\% when the 2008 data were compared with the data for 2006 (from 9.0 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in 2006 to 11.0 in 2008 for the 11 sites that provided data for both surveillance years) and an estimated increase of 78\% when the 2008 data were compared with the data for 2002 (from 6.4 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in 2002 to 11.4 in 2008 for the 13 sites that provided data for both surveillance years). Because the ADDM Network sites do not make up a nationally representative sample, these combined prevalence estimates should not be generalized to the United States as a whole.
INTERPRETATION: These data confirm that the estimated prevalence of ASDs identified in the ADDM network surveillance populations continues to increase. The extent to which these increases reflect better case ascertainment as a result of increases in awareness and access to services or true increases in prevalence of ASD symptoms is not known. ASDs continue to be an important public health concern in the United States, underscoring the need for continued resources to identify potential risk factors and to provide essential supports for persons with ASDs and their families.
PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Given substantial increases in ASD prevalence estimates over a relatively short period, overall and within various subgroups of the population, continued monitoring is needed to quantify and understand these patterns. With 5 biennial surveillance years completed in the past decade, the ADDM Network continues to monitor prevalence and characteristics of ASDs and other developmental disabilities for the 2010 surveillance year. Further work is needed to evaluate multiple factors contributing to increases in estimated ASD prevalence over time. ADDM Network investigators continue to explore these factors, with a focus on understanding disparities in the identification of ASDs among certain subgroups and on how these disparities have contributed to changes in the estimated prevalence of ASDs. CDC is partnering with other federal and private partners in a coordinated response to identify risk factors for ASDs and to meet the needs of persons with ASDs and their families.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autism prevalence in California, based on individuals eligible for state-funded services, rose throughout the 1990s. The extent to which this trend is explained by changes in age at diagnosis or inclusion of milder cases has not been previously evaluated.
METHODS: Autism cases were identified from 1990 through 2006 in databases of the California Department of Developmental Services, which coordinates services for individuals with specific developmental disorders. The main outcomes were population incident cases younger than age 10 years for each quarter, cumulative incidence by age and birth year, age-specific incidence rates stratified by birth year, and proportions of diagnoses by age across birth years.
RESULTS: Autism incidence in children rose throughout the period. Cumulative incidence to 5 years of age per 10,000 births rose consistently from 6.2 for 1990 births to 42.5 for 2001 births. Age-specific incidence rates increased most steeply for 2- and 3-year olds. The proportion diagnosed by age 5 years increased only slightly, from 54\% for 1990 births to 61\% for 1996 births. Changing age at diagnosis can explain a 12\% increase, and inclusion of milder cases, a 56\% increase.
CONCLUSIONS: Autism incidence in California shows no sign yet of plateauing. Younger ages at diagnosis, differential migration, changes in diagnostic criteria, and inclusion of milder cases do not fully explain the observed increases. Other artifacts have yet to be quantified, and as a result, the extent to which the continued rise represents a true increase in the occurrence of autism remains unclear.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (autism) and schizophrenia are highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting the lives of many individuals. It is important to increase our understanding of how the polygenic risk for neurodevelopmental disorders manifests during childhood in boys and girls.
METHODS: Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for ADHD, autism and schizophrenia were calculated in a subsample of 15 205 children from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Mother-reported traits of repetitive behavior, social communication, language and motor difficulties, hyperactivity and inattention were measured in children at 6 and 18 months, 3, 5 and 8 years. Linear regression models in a multigroup framework were used to investigate associations between the three PRS and dimensional trait measures in MoBa, using sex as a grouping variable.
RESULTS: Before the age of 2, the ADHD PRS was robustly associated with hyperactivity and inattention, with increasing strength up to 8 years, and with language difficulties at age 5 and 8. The autism PRS was robustly associated with language difficulties at 18 months, motor difficulties at 36 months, and hyperactivity and inattention at 8 years. We did not identify robust associations for the schizophrenia PRS. In general, the PRS associations were similar in boys and girls. The association between ADHD PRS and hyperactivity at 18 months was, however, stronger in boys.
CONCLUSIONS: Polygenic risk for autism and ADHD in the general population manifests early in childhood and broadly across behavioral measures of neurodevelopmental traits.},

	abstract = {The goal of the Bright Futures project is to respond to the emerging preventive and health promotion needs of infants, children, and adolescents. Bright Futures is sponsored by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the United States Public Health Service and the Medicaid Bureau of the Health Care Financing Administration. Over 100 professionals, representing a spectrum of child health perspectives, came together to develop health supervision guidelines to advance health needs of children. They asked the question, "How can health professionals and other caregivers become more effective in disease prevention and health promotion for children?" The Bright Futures guidelines arise from the belief that effective health supervision requires a partnership between health professionals  and families. The health professional must use a "contextual approach," becoming sensitive to the child's environment, including health, educational, and social issues. This guide is divided into four sections that correspond to the four periods of development of infancy (0-12 months), early childhood (1-5 years), middle childhood (5-11 years), and adolescence (11-21 years). Each section includes: (1) a theme chapter; (2) a chart of developmental achievements, tasks, and outcomes; (3) a list of instructions concerning health supervision to be provided to the family by health professionals; (4) a list of child, family, and community strengths; (5) a list of health-related issues; (6) descriptions of what typically occurs at periodic visits of children and families to health professionals;  (7) a health supervision summary; and (8) a bibliography. Nine appendixes present information on various aspects of child health including recommended immunization schedules, lead toxicity screening, and vision screening. One including recommended immigration schedules, lead toxicity screening, and vision screening. One appendix is a bibliography of approximately 100 items related to the Bright Futures project.

To account for group-level variation, and improve model ﬁt, researchers will commonly specify either a ﬁxed or random eﬀects model. But current advice on which approach should be preferred, and under what conditions, remains vague and sometimes contradictory. We cast the problem from an experimental, rather than theoretical, perspective, and oﬀer a typology of dataset characteristics that can help guide applied researchers in their model choice. Through a series of Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the total error due to bias and variance in the inferences of each model, for many diﬀerent sizes and types of datasets common in political science research. Our analysis further demonstrates that the popular Hausman speciﬁcation test is nether a necessary nor suﬃcient statistic for choosing between ﬁxed and random eﬀects.},

	abstract = {Multicentre studies are common in epidemiological research aiming at identifying disease risk factors. A major advantage of multicentre over single-centre studies is that, by including a larger number of participants, they allow consideration of rare outcomes and exposures. Their multicentric nature introduces some complexities at the step of data analysis, in particular when it comes to controlling for confounding by centre, which is the focus of this tutorial. Commonly, epidemiologists use one of the following options: pooling all centre-speciﬁc data and adjusting for centre using ﬁxed effects; adjusting for centre using random effects; or ﬁtting centre-speciﬁc models and combining the results in a meta-analysis. Here, we illustrate the similarities of and differences between these three modelling approaches, explain the reasons why they may provide different conclusions and offer advice on which model to choose depending on the characteristics of the study. Two key issues to examine during the analyses are to distinguish within-centre from between-centre associations, and the possible heterogeneity of the effects (of exposure and/or confounders) by centre. A real epidemiological study is used to illustrate a situation in which these various options yield different results. A synthetic dataset and R and Stata codes are provided to reproduce the results.},

Thus, a matched design may require controlling for the matching factors in the analysis. However, it is not the case that a matched design requires a matched analysis. Provided that there are no problems of sparse data, control for the matching factors can be obtained, with no loss of validity and a possible increase in precision, using a “standard” (unconditional) analysis, and a “matched” (conditional) analysis may not be required or appropriate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Since their widespread introduction more than half a century ago, intensive care units (ICUs) have become an integral part of the health care system. Although most ICUs are found in high-income countries, they are increasingly a feature of health care systems in low- and middle-income countries. The World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine convened a task force whose objective was to answer the question “What is an ICU?” in an internationally meaningful manner and to develop a system for stratifying ICUs on the basis of the intensity of the care they provide. We undertook a scoping review of the peer-reviewed and gray literature to assemble existing models for ICU stratification. Based on these and on discussions among task force members by teleconference and 2 face-to-face meetings, we present a proposed definition and classification of ICUs. An ICU is an organized system for the provision of care to critically ill patients that provides intensive and specialized medical and nursing care, an enhanced capacity for monitoring, and multiple modalities of physiologic organ support to sustain life during a period of life-threatening organ system insufficiency. Although an ICU is based in a defined geographic area of a hospital, its activities often extend beyond the walls of the physical space to include the emergency department, hospital ward, and follow-up clinic. A level 1 ICU is capable of providing oxygen, noninvasive monitoring, and more intensive nursing care than on a ward, whereas a level 2 ICU can provide invasive monitoring and basic life support for a short period. A level 3 ICU provides a full spectrum of monitoring and life support technologies, serves as a regional resource for the care of critically ill patients, and may play an active role in developing the specialty of intensive care through research and education. A formal definition and descriptive framework for ICUs can inform health care decision-makers in planning and measuring capacity and provide clinicians and patients with a benchmark to evaluate the level of resources available for clinical care.},

RESULTS: Among the 275 patients, the average age was 40.7±16.4, with a preponderance of males (54.5\%). The three commonest symptoms presented were cough (21.3\%), headache (15.7\%), and sore throat (11.7\%). Only 7.6\% of the patients had a history of fever. Most patients were asymptomatic (51.65). Approximately 38.9\% have an underlying co-morbid NCDs, with Hypertension (32.1\%), Diabetes (9.9\%), and Asthma (5.2\%) being the three commonest. The odds of Moderate/severe (MoS) was significantly higher for those with unknown exposures to similar illness [aOR(95\%CI) = 4.27(1.12-10.2)] compared with non-exposure to similar illness. An increased unit of NCD's count significantly increased the odds of COVID-19 MoS illness by 26\%[cOR(95\%CI) =1.26(1.09-1.84)] and 67\% (adjusting for age) [aOR(95\%CI)=1.67(1.13-2.49)].
CONCLUSION: The presence of cardiovascular co-morbidities dictated the frequency of reported symptoms and severity of COVID-19 infection in this sample of Ghanaians. Physicians should be aware of the presence of co-morbid NCDs and prepare to manage effectively among COVID-19 patients.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mortality statistics are fundamental to public health decision making. Mortality varies by time and location, and its measurement is affected by well known biases that have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aims to estimate excess mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic in 191 countries and territories, and 252 subnational units for selected countries, from Jan 1, 2020, to Dec 31, 2021.
METHODS: All-cause mortality reports were collected for 74 countries and territories and 266 subnational locations (including 31 locations in low-income and middle-income countries) that had reported either weekly or monthly deaths from all causes during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, and for up to 11 year previously. In addition, we obtained excess mortality data for 12 states in India. Excess mortality over time was calculated as observed mortality, after excluding data from periods affected by late registration and anomalies such as heat waves, minus expected mortality. Six models were used to estimate expected mortality; final estimates of expected mortality were based on an ensemble of these models. Ensemble weights were based on root mean squared errors derived from an out-of-sample predictive validity test. As mortality records are incomplete worldwide, we built a statistical model that predicted the excess mortality rate for locations and periods where all-cause mortality data were not available. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression as a variable selection mechanism and selected 15 covariates, including both covariates pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as seroprevalence, and to background population health metrics, such as the Healthcare Access and Quality Index, with direction of effects on excess mortality concordant with a meta-analysis by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With the selected best model, we ran a prediction process using 100 draws for each covariate and 100 draws of estimated coefficients and residuals, estimated from the regressions run at the draw level using draw-level input data on both excess mortality and covariates. Mean values and 95\% uncertainty intervals were then generated at national, regional, and global levels. Out-of-sample predictive validity testing was done on the basis of our final model specification.
FINDINGS: Although reported COVID-19 deaths between Jan 1, 2020, and Dec 31, 2021, totalled 5·94 million worldwide, we estimate that 18·2 million (95\% uncertainty interval 17·1-19·6) people died worldwide because of the COVID-19 pandemic (as measured by excess mortality) over that period. The global all-age rate of excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic was 120·3 deaths (113·1-129·3) per 100 000 of the population, and excess mortality rate exceeded 300 deaths per 100 000 of the population in 21 countries. The number of excess deaths due to COVID-19 was largest in the regions of south Asia, north Africa and the Middle East, and eastern Europe. At the country level, the highest numbers of cumulative excess deaths due to COVID-19 were estimated in India (4·07 million [3·71-4·36]), the USA (1·13 million [1·08-1·18]), Russia (1·07 million [1·06-1·08]), Mexico (798 000 [741 000-867 000]), Brazil (792 000 [730 000-847 000]), Indonesia (736 000 [594 000-955 000]), and Pakistan (664 000 [498 000-847 000]). Among these countries, the excess mortality rate was highest in Russia (374·6 deaths [369·7-378·4] per 100 000) and Mexico (325·1 [301·6-353·3] per 100 000), and was similar in Brazil (186·9 [172·2-199·8] per 100 000) and the USA (179·3 [170·7-187·5] per 100 000).
INTERPRETATION: The full impact of the pandemic has been much greater than what is indicated by reported deaths due to COVID-19 alone. Strengthening death registration systems around the world, long understood to be crucial to global public health strategy, is necessary for improved monitoring of this pandemic and future pandemics. In addition, further research is warranted to help distinguish the proportion of excess mortality that was directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and the changes in causes of death as an indirect consequence of the pandemic.

	abstract = {Genetic variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been globally surging and devastating many countries around the world. There are at least eleven reported variants dedicated with inevitably catastrophic consequences. In 2021, the most dominant Delta and Omicron variants were estimated to lead to more severity and deaths than other variants. Furthermore, these variants have some contagious characteristics involving high transmissibility, more severe illness, and an increased mortality rate. All outbreaks caused by the Delta variant have been rapidly skyrocketing in infection cases in communities despite tough restrictions in 2021. Apart from it, the United States, the United Kingdom and other high-rate vaccination rollout countries are still wrestling with this trend because the Delta variant can result in a significant number of breakthrough infections. However, the pandemic has changed since the latest SARS-CoV-2 variant in late 2021 in South Africa, Omicron. The preliminary data suggest that the Omicron variant possesses 100-fold greater than the Delta variant in transmissibility. Therefore, this paper aims to review these characteristics based on the available meta-data and information from the first emergence to recent days. Australia and the five most affected countries, including the United States, India, Brazil, France, as well as the United Kingdom, are selected in order to review the transmissibility, severity and fatality due to Delta and Omicron variants. Finally, the vaccination programs for each country are also reviewed as the main factor in prevention.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to systematically review current studies reporting on clinical outcomes in people living with HIV (PLHIV) infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Global Health, SCOPUS, Medline and EMBASE using pertinent key words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms relating to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and HIV. A narrative synthesis was undertaken. Articles are summarized in relevant sections.
RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-five articles were identified after duplicates had been removed. After screening, eight studies were analysed, totalling 70 HIV-infected patients (57 without AIDS and 13 with AIDS). Three themes were identified: (1) controlled HIV infection does not appear to result in poorer COVID-19 outcomes, (2) more data are needed to determine COVID-19 outcomes in patients with AIDS and (3) HIV-infected patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms should be investigated for superinfections.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PLHIV with well-controlled disease are not at risk of poorer COVID-19 disease outcomes than the general population. It is not clear whether those with poorly controlled HIV disease and AIDS have poorer outcomes. Superimposed bacterial pneumonia may be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19 but further research is urgently needed to elucidate whether PLHIV are more at risk than the general population.},

We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics associated with the disease severity and mortality in hypertensive vs. non-hypertensive deceased COVID-19 patients. Methods: We included all the deceased patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to {\textgreater}200 health facilities in Wuhan between December 1 and February 24, 2020. The median survival time in COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension, the association of hypertension with the disease severity, and the risk factors associated with the COVID-19 mortality stratified by the hypertension status were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, logistic regression, and Cox proportional regression, respectively before and after the propensity score-matching (PS) for age and sex. Results: The prevalence of hypertension in the studied 1,833 COVID-19 patients was 40.5\%. Patients with hypertension were more likely to have severe COVID-19 illness than patients without hypertension; the PS-matched multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (95\% CI) was 2.44 (1.77-3.08). Moreover, the median survival time in the hypertension group was 3-5 days shorter than the non-hypertension group. There was a 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 mortality in the hypertension group compared with the non-hypertension group; the PS-matched multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 2.04 (1.61-2.72), and the significant increased risk of COVID-19 mortality in the moderate vs. mild COVID-19 illness was confined to patients with hypertension. Additionally, the history and the number of underlying chronic diseases, occupation, and residential location showed stronger associations with the COVID-19 mortality among patients with hypertension than patients without hypertension.

Although glycemic control in individuals with already known diabetes mellitus did not worsen during the pandemic, there was a worrying increase in diabetic ketoacidosis in children with new-onset diabetes, probably due to containment measures and delayed access to emergency departments. Moreover, new evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has the capacity to directly and indirectly induce pancreatic β-cell destruction, and the risk of newly diagnosed diabetes after COVID-19 increased in both children and adults. While long-term studies continue to follow children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, this review discusses available findings on the relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes. It is important to emphasize the need to maintain close links between families of children with chronic conditions and their pediatricians, as well as to promote early access to healthcare services, in order to reduce dangerous delays in diabetes diagnosis and prevent diabetic ketoacidosis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess the association between previous or preexisting cardiovascular conditions and severity of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study used data from a large, multicenter, electronic health records database in the US. The cohort included patients aged 2 months to 17 years with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 or a diagnosis code indicating infection or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at 85 health systems between March 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021. EXPOSURES Diagnoses for 26 cardiovascular conditions between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019 (before infection with SARS-CoV-2). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as need for supplemental oxygen or in-hospital death. Mixed-effects, random intercept logistic regression modeling assessed the significance and magnitude of associations between 26 cardiovascular conditions and COVID-19 severity. Multiple comparison adjustment was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate procedure.
RESULTS The study comprised 171 416 pediatric patients; the median age was 8 years (IQR, 2-14 years), and 50.28\% were male. Of these patients, 17 065 (9.96\%) had severe COVID-19. The random intercept model showed that the following cardiovascular conditions were associated with severe COVID-19: cardiac arrest (odds ratio [OR], 9.92; 95\% CI, 6.93-14.20), cardiogenic shock (OR, 3.07; 95\% CI, 1.90-4.96), heart surgery (OR, 3.04; 95\% CI, 2.26-4.08), cardiopulmonary disease (OR, 1.91; 95\% CI, 1.56-2.34), heart failure (OR, 1.82; 95\% CI, 1.46-2.26), hypotension (OR, 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.38-1.79), nontraumatic cerebral hemorrhage (OR, 1.54; 95\% CI, 1.24-1.91), pericarditis (OR, 1.50; 95\% CI, 1.17-1.94), simple biventricular defects (OR, 1.45; 95\% CI, 1.29-1.62), venous embolism and thrombosis (OR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.11-1.73), other hypertensive disorders (OR, 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.09-1.63), complex biventricular defects (OR, 1.33; 95\% CI, 1.14-1.54), and essential primary hypertension (OR, 1.22; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.38). Furthermore, 194 of 258 patients (75.19\%) with a history of cardiac arrest were younger than 12 years.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To understand critical paediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate factors associated with mortality in children from high and low-middle income countries.
METHODS: Prospective, observational study of critically ill children hospitalised for COVID-19 in 18 countries throughout North America, Latin America, and Europe between April 1 and December 31, 2020. Associations with mortality were evaluated using logistic regression.
FINDINGS: 557 patients (median age, 8 years; 24\% {\textless}2 years) were enrolled from 55 sites (63\% Latin American). Half had comorbidities. Invasive (41\%) or non-invasive (20\%) ventilation and vasopressors (56\%) were the most common support modalities. Hospital mortality was 10\% and higher in children {\textless}2 years old (15\%; odds ratio 1·94, 95\%CI 1·08-3·49). Most who died had pulmonary disease. When adjusted for age, sex, region, and illness severity, mortality-associated factors included cardiac (aOR 2·89; 95\%CI 1·2-6·94) or pulmonary comorbidities (aOR 4·43; 95\%CI 1·70-11·5), admission hypoxemia (aOR 2·44; 95\%CI 1·30-4·57), and lower respiratory symptoms (aOR 2·96; 95\%CI 1·57-5·59). MIS-C (aOR 0·25; 95\%CI 0·1-0·61) and receiving methylprednisolone (aOR 0·5; 95\%CI 0·25-0·99), IVIG (aOR 0·32; 95\%CI 0·16-0·62), or anticoagulation (aOR 0·49; 95\%CI 0·25-0·95) were associated with lower mortality although these associations might be limited to children {\textgreater}2 years old.
INTERPRETATION: We identified factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in critically ill children from both high and low-middle income countries, including higher mortality with younger age and COVID-related pulmonary disease but lower mortality in MIS-C. Further research is needed on optimal treatments for younger children and respiratory failure in paediatric COVID-19.

Here, we found that the COVID-19 mortality rate is U-shaped in childhood: it initially decreases, reaching the minimum at the ages 3-10 years, and then increases throughout life. All-cause mortality and mortality from other diseases, such as pneumonia and influenza, show a similar pattern; however, childhood mortality rates from COVID-19 are considerably lower than from other diseases, with the best relative protection achieved at the youngest ages. Consistent with this, the fraction of COVID-19 deaths among all deaths increases as a function of age throughout childhood and the entire life. We discuss implications of the elevated postnatal COVID-19 risk and lower childhood COVID-19 mortality compared to other diseases.},

	abstract = {Emerging data suggest that the effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2 are far reaching extending beyond those with severe acute disease. Specifically, the presence of persistent symptoms after apparent resolution from COVID-19 have frequently been reported throughout the pandemic by individuals labeled as "long-haulers". The purpose of this study was to assess for symptoms at days 0-10 and 61+ among subjects with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The University of California COvid Research Data Set (UC CORDS) was used to identify 1407 records that met inclusion criteria. Symptoms attributable to COVID-19 were extracted from the electronic health record. Symptoms reported over the previous year prior to COVID-19 were excluded, using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) followed by graph lasso to assess relationships between symptoms. A model was developed predictive for becoming a long-hauler based on symptoms. 27\% reported persistent symptoms after 60 days. Women were more likely to become long-haulers, and all age groups were represented with those aged 50 ± 20 years comprising 72\% of cases. Presenting symptoms included palpitations, chronic rhinitis, dysgeusia, chills, insomnia, hyperhidrosis, anxiety, sore throat, and headache among others. We identified 5 symptom clusters at day 61+: chest pain-cough, dyspnea-cough, anxiety-tachycardia, abdominal pain-nausea, and low back pain-joint pain. Long-haulers represent a very significant public health concern, and there are no guidelines to address their diagnosis and management. Additional studies are urgently needed that focus on the physical, mental, and emotional impact of long-term COVID-19 survivors who become long-haulers.},

	abstract = {Background There were limited epidemiological data of pediatric COVID-19 in Asia outside China, especially during the era of the variants of concern such as the Delta and Alpha variants. The objective was to describe the clinical epidemiology of pediatric COVID-19 in a tertiary care center in Thailand from April to August 2021. The identification of risk factors for the development of pneumonia in these children was also performed. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted by retrospective chart review of all children aged 0–15 years admitted to Thammasat University Hospital care system during the study period. The risk factors for the development of pneumonia were analyzed using logistic regression. Results A total of 698 children were included for analysis, of which 52\% were male. The mean age of the cohort was 7.2 + 4.5 years old. Radiographic pneumonia was identified in 100 children (14.3\%) and a total of 16 children (2.3\%) were diagnosed with severe and critical diseases. The mortality rate was 0.1\%. Children younger than 1 year and children with comorbidity were at higher risk of developing pneumonia (Adjusted odds ratios 2.99 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.56–5.74) and 2.32 (95\% CI: 1.15–4.67), respectively). Conclusion In the era of the variants of concern, the proportion of children with severe and critical diseases remained low. However, prudence must be taken in caring for younger children and children with comorbidity.},

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis.
SETTING: 260 hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 17 January and 3 July 2020, with a minimum follow-up time of two weeks (to 17 July 2020).
PARTICIPANTS: 651 children and young people aged less than 19 years admitted to 138 hospitals and enrolled into the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emergency Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK study with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Admission to critical care (high dependency or intensive care), in-hospital mortality, or meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C.
RESULTS: Median age was 4.6 (interquartile range 0.3-13.7) years, 35\% (225/651) were under 12 months old, and 56\% (367/650) were male. 57\% (330/576) were white, 12\% (67/576) South Asian, and 10\% (56/576) black. 42\% (276/651) had at least one recorded comorbidity. A systemic mucocutaneous-enteric cluster of symptoms was identified, which encompassed the symptoms for the WHO MIS-C criteria. 18\% (116/632) of children were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis, this was associated with age under 1 month (odds ratio 3.21, 95\% confidence interval 1.36 to 7.66; P=0.008), age 10-14 years (3.23, 1.55 to 6.99; P=0.002), and black ethnicity (2.82, 1.41 to 5.57; P=0.003). Six (1\%) of 627 patients died in hospital, all of whom had profound comorbidity. 11\% (52/456) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the first patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Children meeting MIS-C criteria were older (median age 10.7 (8.3-14.1) v 1.6 (0.2-12.9) years; P{\textless}0.001) and more likely to be of non-white ethnicity (64\% (29/45) v 42\% (148/355); P=0.004). Children with MIS-C were five times more likely to be admitted to critical care (73\% (38/52) v 15\% (62/404); P{\textless}0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with MIS-C were more likely to present with fatigue (51\% (24/47) v 28\% (86/302); P=0.004), headache (34\% (16/47) v 10\% (26/263); P{\textless}0.001), myalgia (34\% (15/44) v 8\% (21/270); P{\textless}0.001), sore throat (30\% (14/47) v (12\% (34/284); P=0.003), and lymphadenopathy (20\% (9/46) v 3\% (10/318); P{\textless}0.001) and to have a platelet count of less than 150 × 109/L (32\% (16/50) v 11\% (38/348); P{\textless}0.001) than children who did not have MIS-C. No deaths occurred in the MIS-C group.
CONCLUSIONS: Children and young people have less severe acute covid-19 than adults. A systemic mucocutaneous-enteric symptom cluster was also identified in acute cases that shares features with MIS-C. This study provides additional evidence for refining the WHO MIS-C preliminary case definition. Children meeting the MIS-C criteria have different demographic and clinical features depending on whether they have acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (polymerase chain reaction positive) or are post-acute (antibody positive).

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan City, China, causing a cluster of cases of severe pneumonia (COVID-19), and becoming a global pandemic. Individuals of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, but older age and underlying comorbidities are known to be associated with increased risk of disease severity and mortality. However, despite the rapidly increasing amount of data on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, data on how SARS-CoV-2 affects children and adolescents remain limited and conflicting, with an increased spectrum of disease manifestations emerging (eg, multisystem inflammatory syndrome). Critical research needs have emerged with important public policy implications.

In initial data from China, children had significantly lower rates and severity of COVID-19 than adults; 2\% of cases were aged 0–19 years, 0.9\% {\textless}10 years, with no child deaths.1 Children continue to constitute a …},

In this review, we discuss proposed hypotheses for the age-related difference in severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Factors proposed to explain the difference in severity of COVID-19 in children and adults include those that put adults at higher risk and those that protect children. The former include: (1) age-related increase in endothelial damage and changes in clotting function; (2) higher density, increased affinity and different distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors and transmembrane serine protease 2; (3) pre-existing coronavirus antibodies (including antibody-dependent enhancement) and T cells; (4) immunosenescence and inflammaging, including the effects of chronic cytomegalovirus infection; (5) a higher prevalence of comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and (6) lower levels of vitamin D. Factors that might protect children include: (1) differences in innate and adaptive immunity; (2) more frequent recurrent and concurrent infections; (3) pre-existing immunity to coronaviruses; (4) differences in microbiota; (5) higher levels of melatonin; (6) protective off-target effects of live vaccines and (7) lower intensity of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.},

We evaluated risk of severe COVID-19 among adults with and without exposure to young children in a large, integrated healthcare system. Adults with children 0-5 years were matched 1:1 to adults with children 6-11 years, 12-18 years, and those without children based upon a COVID-19 propensity score and risk factors for severe COVID-19. COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and need for intensive care unit (ICU) were assessed in 3,126,427 adults, of whom 24\% (N = 743,814) had children 18 years or younger, and 8.8\% (N = 274,316) had a youngest child 0-5 years. After 1:1 matching, propensity for COVID-19 infection and risk factors for severe COVID-19 were well balanced between groups. Rates of COVID-19 infection were slightly higher for adults with exposure to older children (incident risk ratio, 1.09, 95\% confidence interval, [1.05-1.12] and IRR 1.09 [1.05-1.13] for adults with children 6-11 and 12-18, respectively), compared to those with children 0-5 years, although no difference in rates of COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization or ICU admission was observed. However, adults without exposure to children had lower rates of COVID-19 infection (IRR 0.85, [0.83-0.87]) but significantly higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalization (IRR 1.49, [1.29-1.73]) and hospitalization requiring ICU admission (IRR 1.76, [1.19-2.58]) compared to those with children aged 0-5.

We report on the comparative disease severity between infants and older children in a multicenter retrospective cohort study of children 0 to 17 years old admitted for acute COVID-19 from February 2020 through May 2021 in 17 pediatric hospitals. We compare clinical and laboratory characteristics and estimate the association between age group and disease severity using ordinal logistic regression. We found that infants comprised one-third of cases, but were admitted for a shorter period (median 3 days IQR 2-5 versus 4 days IQR 2-7), had a lower likelihood to have an increased C-reactive protein, and had half the odds of older children of having severe or critical disease (OR 0.50 (95\% confidence interval 0.32-0.78)).    Conclusion: When compared to older children, there appeared to be a lower threshold to admit infants but their length of stay was shorter and they had lower odds than older children of progressing to severe or critical disease. What is Known: • A small proportion of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 require hospitalization for acute COVID-19 with a subgroup needing specialized intensive care to treat more severe disease. • For most infectious diseases including viral respiratory tract infections, disease severity by age is J-shaped, with infants having more severe disease compared to older children. What is New: • One-third of admitted children for acute COVID-19 during the first 14 months of the pandemic were infants. • Infants had half the odds of older children of having severe or critical disease.},

	abstract = {Background: COVID-19 is an extremely severe infectious disease. However, few studies have focused on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pediatric COVID-19. This study conducted a retrospective review of the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 in children.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on children with a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 in mainland China using the web crawler technique to collect anonymous COVID-19 updates published by local health authorities.
Results: Three hundred forty-one children aged 4 days to 14 years with a median age of 7 years were included. Sixty-six percent of pediatric patients were infected via family members with COVID-19. The median incubation period was 9 days (interquartile range, 6 to 13). Asymptomatic cases accounted for 5.9\%, of which 30\% had abnormal chest radiologic findings. A majority of pediatric COVID-19 cases showed mild to moderate clinical features, and only a few developed severe or critical diseases (0.6\% and 0.3\%, respectively). Fever (77.9\%) and cough (32.4\%) were the predominant presenting symptoms of pediatric COVID-19. The pediatric patients had fewer underlying diseases and complications than adults. The treatment modalities for pediatric COVID-19 patients were not as complex as those of adult COVID-19 patients. The overall prognosis of pediatric COVID-19 was benign with a decent recovery. The median time from onset to cure was 16 days (interquartile range, 13 to 21).
Conclusions: Compared to adults, COVID-19 in children has distinct features of epidemiology and clinical manifestations. The findings from this study might help to guide the development of measures to prevent and treat this ongoing global pandemic.

The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1\%-5\% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases, they often have milder disease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare. Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia. Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children, and lymphocytopenia seemed rare. Newborn infants have developed symptomatic COVID-19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission was scarce. Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances.

	abstract = {Importance:
While much of the attention on the COVID-19 pandemic was directed at the daily counts of cases and those with serious disease overwhelming health services, increasingly, reports have appeared of people who experience debilitating symptoms after the initial infection. This is popularly known as long COVID.

Objective:
To estimate by country and territory of the number of patients affected by long COVID in 2020 and 2021, the severity of their symptoms and expected pattern of recovery

Design:
We jointly analyzed ten ongoing cohort studies in ten countries for the occurrence of three major symptom clusters of long COVID among representative COVID cases. The defining symptoms of the three clusters (fatigue, cognitive problems, and shortness of breath) are explicitly mentioned in the WHO clinical case definition. For incidence of long COVID, we adopted the minimum duration after infection of three months from the WHO case definition. We pooled data from the contributing studies, two large medical record databases in the United States, and findings from 44 published studies using a Bayesian meta-regression tool. We separately estimated occurrence and pattern of recovery in patients with milder acute infections and those hospitalized. We estimated the incidence and prevalence of long COVID globally and by country in 2020 and 2021 as well as the severity-weighted prevalence using disability weights from the Global Burden of Disease study.

Results:
Analyses are based on detailed information for 1906 community infections and 10526 hospitalized patients from the ten collaborating cohorts, three of which included children. We added published data on 37262 community infections and 9540 hospitalized patients as well as ICD-coded medical record data concerning 1.3 million infections. Globally, in 2020 and 2021, 144.7 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 54.8–312.9) people suffered from any of the three symptom clusters of long COVID. This corresponds to 3.69\% (1.38–7.96) of all infections. The fatigue, respiratory, and cognitive clusters occurred in 51.0\% (16.9–92.4), 60.4\% (18.9–89.1), and 35.4\% (9.4–75.1) of long COVID cases, respectively. Those with milder acute COVID-19 cases had a quicker estimated recovery (median duration 3.99 months [IQR 3.84–4.20]) than those admitted for the acute infection (median duration 8.84 months [IQR 8.10–9.78]). At twelve months, 15.1\% (10.3–21.1) continued to experience long COVID symptoms.

Conclusions and relevance:
The occurrence of debilitating ongoing symptoms of COVID-19 is common. Knowing how many people are affected, and for how long, is important to plan for rehabilitative services and support to return to social activities, places of learning, and the workplace when symptoms start to wane.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.envres.2022.115068},
	abstract = {Background and objectives
Studies focusing on the neurodevelopmental effects of phthalates seldom consider exposure during infancy, a critical period for brain development. Most rely on parent-completed questionnaires to assess child neurodevelopment, which may be subject to reporting error. We studied the associations between prenatal and infancy exposure to phthalates and objective measures of neurodevelopment at the age of two.
Methods
We relied on 151 mother-child pairs from the SEPAGES mother-child cohort. Women were asked to collect three spot urine samples per day over seven consecutive days during the second (median: 18.0 gestational weeks) and third (median: 34.2 gestational weeks) trimesters of pregnancy. They then collected one urine sample per day over seven consecutive days from their infants around the age of 12 months. Metabolites of phthalates and non-phthalate plasticizers were measured in within-subject and within-period pools of repeated urine samples. Eye tracking tasks were performed at two years allowing to compute four indicators linked with cognitive development and visual behavior: mean fixation duration, novelty preference, percent time spent looking at the eyes and mean reaction time.
Results
Pre-natal exposure to monobenzyl phthalate at the second and third trimesters was associated with shorter fixation durations. In models allowing for interaction with child sex, these associations were only observed among girls. Exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate at the third but not the second trimester was associated with increased time spent looking at a novel face and eyes. We observed faster reaction times and decreased time spent looking at the eyes in a face recognition task, with increased post-natal exposure to monoethyl, mono-iso-butyl and mono-n-butyl phthalates.
Discussion
Relying on improved exposure assessment, we highlighted associations of pre- and post-natal exposure to phthalates with indicators derived from eye tracking tasks, mainly in girls. Some of these indicators have been affected in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {Background Long Covid, characterised by symptoms after Covid-19 infection which persist for longer than 12 weeks, is becoming an important societal and economic problem. As Long Covid was novel in 2020, there has been debate regarding its aetiology and whether it is one, or multiple, syndromes. This study assessed risk factors associated with Long Covid and examined symptom clusters that might indicate sub-types.
Methods 4,040 participants reporting for {\textgreater}4 months in the Covid Symptom Study App were included. Multivariate logistic regression was undertaken to identify risk factors associated with Long Covid. Cluster analysis (K-modes and hierarchical agglomerative clustering) and factor analysis were undertaken to investigate symptom clusters.
Results Long Covid affected 13.6\% of participants. Significant risk factors included being female (P {\textless} 0.01), pre-existing poor health (P {\textless} 0.01), and worse symptoms in the initial illness. A model incorporating sociodemographics, comorbidities, and health status predicted Long Covid with an accuracy (AUROC) of 76\%. The three clustering approaches gave rise to different sets of clusters with no consistent pattern across methods.
Conclusions Our model of risk factors may help clinicians predict patients at higher risk of Long Covid, so these patients can rest more, receive treatments, or enter clinical trials; reducing the burden of this long-term and debilitating condition. No consistent subtypes were identified.},

	abstract = {Background Self-reported symptom studies rapidly increased our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic and enabled the monitoring of long-term effects of COVID-19 outside the hospital setting. It is now evident that post-COVID syndrome presents with heterogeneous profiles, which need characterisation to enable personalised care among the most affected survivors. This study describes post-COVID profiles, and how they relate to different viral variants and vaccination status.Methods In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from 336,652 subjects, with regular health reports through the Covid Symptom Study (CSS) smartphone application. These subjects had reported feeling physically normal for at least 30 days before testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. 9,323 individuals subsequently developed Long-COVID, defined as symptoms lasting longer than 28 days. 1,459 had post-COVID syndrome, defined as more than 12 weeks of symptoms. Clustering analysis of the time-series data was performed to identify distinct symptom profiles for post-COVID patients, across variants of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccination status at the time of infection. Clusters were then characterised based on symptom prevalence, duration, demography, and prior conditions (comorbidities).Using an independent testing sample with additional data (n=140), we investigated the impact of post-COVID symptom clusters on the lives of affected individuals.Findings We identified distinct profiles of symptoms for post-COVID syndrome within and across variants: four endotypes were identified for infections due to the wild-type variant; seven for the alpha variant; and five for delta. Across all variants, a cardiorespiratory cluster of symptoms was identified. A second cluster related to central neurological, and a third to cases with the most severe and debilitating multi-organ symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms clustered in no more than two specific phenotypes per viral variant. The three main clusters were confirmed in an independent testing sample, and their functional impact was assessed.Interpretation Unsupervised analysis identified different post-COVID profiles, characterised by differing symptom combinations, durations, and functional outcomes. Phenotypes were at least partially concordant with individuals’ reported experiences.Our classification may be useful to understand distinct mechanisms of the post-COVID syndrome, as well as subgroups of individuals at risk of prolonged debilitation.Funding UK Government Department of Health and Social Care, Chronic Disease Research Foundation, The Wellcome Trust, UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK Research and Innovation London Medical Imaging \& Artificial Intelligence Centre for Value-Based Healthcare, UK National Institute for Health Research, UK Medical Research Council, British Heart Foundation and Alzheimer’s Society, and ZOE Limited, UK.
Evidence before this study We conducted a search in the PubMed Central database, with keywords: (“Long-COVID*” OR “post?covid*” OR “post?COVID*” OR postCOVID* OR postCovid*) AND (cluster* OR endotype* OR phenotype* OR sub?type* OR subtype).On 15 June 2022, 161 documents were identified, of which 24 either provided descriptions of sub-types or proposed phenotypes of Long-COVID or post-COVID syndrome(s). These included 16 studies attempting manual sub-grouping of phenotypes, 6 deployments of unsupervised methods for patient clustering and automatic semantic phenotyping (unsupervised k-means=2; random forest classification=1; other=2), and two reports of uncommon presentations of Long-COVID/post-COVID syndrome. Overall, two to eight symptom profiles (clusters) were identified, with three recurring clusters. A cardiopulmonary syndrome was the predominant observation, manifesting with exertional intolerance and dyspnoea (n=10), fatigue (n=8), autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia or palpitations (n=5), lung radiological abnormalities including fibrosis (n=2), and chest pain (n=1). A second common presentation consisted in persistent general autoimmune activation and proinflammatory state (n=2), comprising multi-organ mild sequelae (n=2), gastrointestinal symptoms (n=2), dermatological symptoms (n=2), and/or fever (n=1). A third syndrome was reported, with neurological or neuropsychiatric symptoms: brain fog or dizziness (n=2), poor memory or cognition (n=2), and other mental health issues including mood disorders (n=5), headache (n=2), central sensitization (n=1), paresthesia (n=1), autonomic dysfunction (n=1), fibromyalgia (n=2), and chronic pain or myalgias (n=6). Unsupervised clustering methods identified two to six different post-COVID phenotypes, mapping to the ones described above.14 further documents focused on possible causes and/or mechanisms of disease underlying one or more manifestations of Long-COVID or post-COVID and identifying immune response dysregulation as a potential common element. All the other documents were beyond the scope of this work.To our knowledge, there are no studies examining the symptom profile of post-COVID syndrome between different variants and vaccination status. Also, no studies reported the modelling of longitudinally collected symptoms, as time-series data, aiming at the characterisation of post-COVID syndrome.Added-value of this study Our study aimed to identify symptom profiles for post-COVID syndrome across the dominant variants in 2020 and 2021, and across vaccination status at the time of infection, using a large sample with prospectively collected longitudinal self-reports of symptoms. For individuals developing 12 weeks or more of symptoms, we identified three main symptom profiles which were consistent across variants and by vaccination status, differing only in the ratio of individuals affected by each profile and symptom duration overall.Implications of all the available evidence We demonstrate the existence of different post-COVID syndromes, which share commonalities across SARS-CoV-2 variant types in both symptoms themselves and how they evolved through the illness. We describe subgroups of patients with specific post-COVID presentations which might reflect different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Given the time-series component, our study is relevant for post-COVID prognostication, indicating how long certain symptoms last. These insights could aid in the development of personalised diagnosis and treatment, as well as helping policymakers plan for the delivery of care for people living with post-COVID syndrome.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify subgroups of COVID-19 survivors exhibiting long-term post-COVID symptoms according to clinical/hospitalization data by using cluster analysis in order to foresee the illness progress and facilitate subsequent prognosis.
METHODS: Age, gender, height, weight, pre-existing medical comorbidities, Internal Care Unit (ICU) admission, days at hospital, and presence of COVID-19 symptoms at hospital admission were collected from hospital records in a sample of patients recovered from COVID-19 at five hospitals in Madrid (Spain). A predefined list of post-COVID symptoms was systematically assessed a mean of 8.4 months (SD 15.5) after hospital discharge. Anxiety/depressive levels and sleep quality were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. Cluster analysis was used to identify groupings of COVID-19 patients without introducing any previous assumptions, yielding three different clusters associating post-COVID symptoms with acute COVID-19 symptoms at hospital admission.
RESULTS: Cluster 2 grouped subjects with lower prevalence of medical co-morbidities, lower number of COVID-19 symptoms at hospital admission, lower number of post-COVID symptoms, and almost no limitations with daily living activities when compared to the others. In contrast, individuals in cluster 0 and 1 exhibited higher number of pre-existing medical co-morbidities, higher number of COVID-19 symptoms at hospital admission, higher number of long-term post-COVID symptoms (particularly fatigue, dyspnea and pain), more limitations on daily living activities, higher anxiety and depressive levels, and worse sleep quality than those in cluster 2.
CONCLUSIONS: The identified subgrouping may reflect different mechanisms which should be considered in therapeutic interventions.},

We performed a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) on the most common self-reported symptoms and hierarchical clustering on the results of the MCA to identify symptom clusters.Two hundred thirty-three individuals were included in the analysis; the median age of the cohort was 43 (interquartile range [IQR], 36–54) years, 74\% were women, and 77.3\% reported a mild initial illness. MCA and hierarchical clustering revealed 3 clusters. Cluster 1 had predominantly pain symptoms with a higher proportion of joint pain, myalgia, and headache; cluster 2 had a preponderance of cardiovascular symptoms with prominent chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations; and cluster 3 had significantly fewer symptoms than the other clusters (2 [IQR, 2–3] symptoms per individual in cluster 3 vs 6 [IQR, 5–7] and 4 [IQR, 3–5] in clusters 1 and 2, respectively; P \&lt; .001). Clusters 1 and 2 had greater functional impairment, demonstrated by significantly longer work absence, higher dyspnea scores, and lower scores in SF-36 domains of general health, physical functioning, and role limitation due to physical functioning and social functioning.Clusters of symptoms are evident in long COVID patients that are associated with functional impairments and may point to distinct underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease.},

Our objective was to design an easy-to-use Long COVID classification to help stratify people with Long COVID. Individual characteristics and a detailed set of 62 self-reported persisting symptoms together with quality of life indexes 12 months after initial COVID-19 infection were collected in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected people in Luxembourg. A hierarchical ascendant classification (HAC) was used to identify clusters of people. We identified three patterns of Long COVID symptoms with a gradient in disease severity. Cluster-Mild encompassed almost 50\% of the study population and was composed of participants with less severe initial infection, fewer comorbidities, and fewer persisting symptoms (mean = 2.9). Cluster-Moderate was characterized by a mean of 11 persisting symptoms and poor sleep and respiratory quality of life. Compared to the other clusters, Cluster-Severe was characterized by a higher proportion of women and smokers with a higher number of Long COVID symptoms, in particular vascular, urinary, and skin symptoms. Our study evidenced that Long COVID can be stratified into three subcategories in terms of severity. If replicated in other populations, this simple classification will help clinicians improve the care of people with Long COVID.},

	abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research., Published research findings are sometimes refuted by subsequent evidence, says Ioannidis, with ensuing confusion and disappointment.},

In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem.

Follow-up was conducted 2 years later.Participants were scheduled for a telephone interview 2 years after acute infection. The presence of post–COVID-19 symptoms was systematically assessed, with particular attention to symptoms starting after infection. Hospitalization and clinical data were collected from medical records. Between-group comparisons and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted.A total of 360 hospitalized patients (162 women [45.0\%]; mean [SD] age, 60.7 [16.1] years) and 308 nonhospitalized patients (183 women [59.4\%]; mean [SD] age, 56.7 [14.7] years) were included. Dyspnea was more prevalent at the onset of illness among hospitalized than among nonhospitalized patients (112 [31.1\%] vs 36 [11.7\%]; P \&lt; .001), whereas anosmia was more prevalent among nonhospitalized than among hospitalized patients (66 [21.4\%] vs 36 [10.0\%]; P = .003). Hospitalized patients were assessed at a mean (SD) of 23.8 (0.6) months after hospital discharge, and nonhospitalized patients were assessed at a mean (SD) of 23.4 (0.7) months after the onset of symptoms. The number of patients who exhibited at least 1 post–COVID-19 symptom 2 years after infection was 215 (59.7\%) among hospitalized patients and 208 (67.5\%) among nonhospitalized patients (P = .01). Among hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients, fatigue (161 [44.7\%] vs 147 [47.7\%]), pain (129 [35.8\%] vs 92 [29.9\%]), and memory loss (72 [20.0\%] vs 49 [15.9\%]) were the most prevalent post–COVID-19 symptoms 2 years after SARS-CoV-2 infection. No significant differences in post–COVID-19 symptoms were observed between hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. The number of preexisting medical comorbidities was associated with post–COVID-19 fatigue (odds ratio [OR], 1.93; 95\% CI, 1.09-3.42; P = .02) and dyspnea (OR, 1.91; 95\% CI, 1.04-3.48; P = .03) among hospitalized patients. The number of preexisting medical comorbidities (OR, 3.75; 95\% CI, 1.67-8.42; P = .001) and the number of symptoms at the onset of illness (OR, 3.84; 95\% CI, 1.33-11.05; P = .01) were associated with post–COVID-19 fatigue among nonhospitalized patients.This cross-sectional study suggested the presence of at least 1 post–COVID-19 symptom in 59.7\% of hospitalized patients and 67.5\% of nonhospitalized patients 2 years after infection. Small differences in symptoms at onset of COVID-19 were identified between hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. Post–COVID-19 symptoms were similar between hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients; however, lack of inclusion of uninfected controls limits the ability to assess the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with overall and specific post–COVID-19 symptoms 2 years after acute infection. Future studies should include uninfected control populations.},

	abstract = {Reports of long-lasting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, the so-called ‘long COVID’, are rising but little is known about prevalence, risk factors or whether it is possible to predict a protracted course early in the disease. We analyzed data from 4,182 incident cases of COVID-19 in which individuals self-reported their symptoms prospectively in the COVID Symptom Study app1. A total of 558 (13.3\%) participants reported symptoms lasting ≥28 days, 189 (4.5\%) for ≥8 weeks and 95 (2.3\%) for ≥12 weeks. Long COVID was characterized by symptoms of fatigue, headache, dyspnea and anosmia and was more likely with increasing age and body mass index and female sex. Experiencing more than five symptoms during the first week of illness was associated with long COVID (odds ratio = 3.53 (2.76–4.50)). A simple model to distinguish between short COVID and long COVID at 7 days (total sample size, n = 2,149) showed an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of 76\%, with replication in an independent sample of 2,472 individuals who were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. This model could be used to identify individuals at risk of long COVID for trials of prevention or treatment and to plan education and rehabilitation services.},

	issn = {1552-9924},
	doi = {10.1289/ehp.1002701},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) is widespread. After exposure, BPA is rapidly metabolized and eliminated in urine. Therefore, there is considerable within-person and between-person variability of BPA concentrations in spot urine samples. However, no information exists on the within-day variability of urinary BPA concentrations.
OBJECTIVES: We examined the between-person and within-person and between-day and within-day variability in the urinary BPA concentrations of eight adults who collected all voids for 1 week to investigate the impact of sampling strategy in the exposure assessment of BPA using spot, first morning, or 24-hr urine collections.
METHODS: We determined the urinary concentrations of BPA using on-line solid-phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: The between-day and within-person variability was the primary contributor to the total variance both for first morning voids (77\%) and 24-hr urine collections (88\%). For the spot collections, we observed considerable within-day variance (70\%), which outweighed the between-person (9\%) and between-day and within-person (21\%) variances.
CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the type of void (spot, first morning, 24-hr collection), urinary BPA concentrations for a given adult changed considerably--both within a day and for the 7 days of the study period. Single 24-hr urine collections accurately reflect daily exposure but can misrepresent variability in daily exposures over time. Of interest, when the population investigated is sufficiently large and samples are randomly collected relative to meal ingestion times and bladder emptying times, the single spot-sampling approach may adequately reflect the average exposure of the population to BPA.},

We infrequently detected monoisononyl phthalate, mono-cyclohexyl phthalate, and mono-n-octyl phthalate, suggesting that human exposures to di-isononyl phthalate, dioctylphthalate, and dicyclohexyl phthalate, respectively, are lower than those listed above, or the pathways, routes of exposure, or pharmacokinetic factors such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination are different. Non-Hispanic blacks had significantly higher concentrations of MEP than did Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Compared with adolescents and adults, children had significantly higher levels of MBP, MBzP, and MEHP but had significantly lower concentrations of MEP. Females had significantly higher concentrations of MEP and MBzP than did males, but similar MEHP levels. Of particular interest, females of all ages had significantly higher concentrations of the reproductive toxicant MBP than did males of all ages; however, women of reproductive age (i.e., 20-39 years of age) had concentrations similar to adolescent girls and women 40 years of age. These population data on exposure to phthalates will serve an important role in public health by helping to set research priorities and by establishing a nationally representative baseline of exposure with which population levels can be compared.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phthalates are metabolized and eliminated in urine within hours after exposure. Several reports suggest that concentrations of phthalate metabolites in a spot urine sample can provide a reliable estimation of exposure to phthalates for up to several months.
OBJECTIVES: We examined inter- and intraperson and inter- and intraday variability in the concentrations of monoethyl phthalate (MEP), the major metabolite of diethyl phthalate, commonly used in personal care products, and mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), a metabolite of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a polyvinyl chloride plasticizer of which diet is the principal exposure source, among eight adults who collected all urine voids (average, 7.6 samples/person/day) for 1 week.
METHODS: We analyzed the urine samples using online solid-phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Regardless of the type of void (spot, first morning, 24-hr collection), for MEP, interperson variability in concentrations accounted for {\textgreater} 75\% of the total variance. By contrast, for MEHHP, within-person variability was the main contributor (69-83\%) of the total variance. Furthermore, we observed considerable intraday variability in the concentrations of spot samples for MEHHP (51\%) and MEP (21\%).
CONCLUSIONS: MEP and MEHHP urinary concentrations varied considerably during 1 week, but the main contributors to the total variance differed (interday variability, MEHHP; interperson variability, MEP) regardless of the sampling strategy (spot, first morning, 24-hr collection). The nature of the exposure (diet vs. other lifestyle factors) and timing of urine sampling to evaluate exposure to phthalates should be considered. For DEHP and phthalates to which people are mostly exposed through diet, collecting 24-hr voids for only 1 day may not be advantageous compared with multiple spot collections. When collecting multiple spot urine samples, changing the time of collection may provide the most complete approach to assess exposure to diverse phthalates.},

	abstract = {Background
Although urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites are frequently used as biomarkers in epidemiologic studies, variability during pregnancy has not been characterized.

Methods
We measured phthalate metabolite concentrations in spot urine samples collected from 246 pregnant Dominican and African-American women. Twenty-eight women had repeat urine samples collected over a 6-week period. We also analyzed 48-hr personal air samples (n = 96 women) and repeated indoor air samples (n = 32 homes) for five phthalate diesters. Mixed-effects models were fit to evaluate reproducibility via intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of using a single specimen versus repeat samples to classify a woman’s exposure in the low or high category.

Results
Phthalates were detected in 85–100\% of air and urine samples. ICCs for the unadjusted urinary metabolite concentrations ranged from 0.30 for mono-ethyl phthalate to 0.66 for monobenzyl phthalate. For indoor air, ICCs ranged from 0.48 [di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)] to 0.83 [butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP)]. Air levels of phthalate diesters correlated with their respective urinary metabolite concentrations for BBzP (r = 0.71), di-isobutyl phthalate (r = 0.44), and diethyl phthalate (DEP; r = 0.39). In women sampled late in pregnancy, specific gravity appeared to be more effective than creatinine in adjusting for urine dilution.

Conclusions
Urinary concentrations of DEP and DEHP metabolites in pregnant women showed lower reproducibility than metabolites for di-n-butyl phthalate and BBzP. A single indoor air sample may be sufficient to characterize phthalate exposure in the home, whereas urinary phthalate biomarkers should be sampled longitudinally during pregnancy to minimize exposure misclassification.},

	abstract = {Bisphenol A is a widely used industrial chemical with many potential sources of human exposure. Bisphenol A is a weak estrogen and has been implicated as an "endocrine disruptor". This term is used for a variety of chemicals encountered in the environment which have estrogenic activity. It has been postulated that human exposure to these chemicals may elicit unwanted estrogenic effects in humans such as reduced fertility, altered development and cancer. Up to now the body burden of bisphenol A in humans is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the metabolism and toxicokinetics of bisphenol A in humans exposed to low doses since systemic bioavailability has a major influence on possible estrogenic effects in vivo. Human subjects (three males and three females, and four males for detailed description of blood kinetics) were administered d(16)-bisphenol A (5 mg). Blood and urine samples were taken in intervals (up to 96 h), metabolites formed were identified by GC/MS and LC-MS/MS and quantified by GC/MS-NCI and LC-MS/MS. d(16)-Bisphenol A glucuronide was the only metabolite of d(16)-bisphenol A detected in urine and blood samples, and concentrations of free d(16)-bisphenol A were below the limit of detection both in urine (6 nM) and blood samples (10 nM). d(16)-Bisphenol A glucuronide was cleared from human blood and excreted with urine with terminal half-lives of less than 6 h; the applied doses were completely recovered in urine as d(16)-bisphenol A glucuronide. Maximum blood levels of d(16)-bisphenol A glucuronide (approximately 800 nM) were measured 80 min after oral administration of d(16)-bisphenol A (5 mg). The obtained data indicate major species differences in the disposition of bisphenol A. Enterohepatic circulation of bisphenol A glucuronide in rats results in a slow rate of excretion, whereas bisphenol A is rapidly conjugated and excreted by humans due to the absence of enterohepatic circulation. The efficient glucuronidation of bisphenol A and the rapid excretion of the formed glucuronide result in a low body burden of the estrogenic bisphenol A in humans following oral absorption of low doses.},

	abstract = {Human metabolism of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) was studied after a single oral dose of 48.1 mg to a male volunteer. To avoid interference by background exposure the D4-ring-labelled DEHP analogue was dosed. Excretion of three metabolites, mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)phthalate (5OH-MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl)phthalate (5oxo-MEHP) and mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP), was monitored for 44 h in urine and for 8 h in serum. Peak concentrations of all metabolites were found in serum after 2 h and in urine after 2 h (MEHP) and after 4 h (5OH-MEHP and 5oxo-MEHP). While the major metabolite in serum was MEHP, the major metabolite in urine was 5OH-MEHP, followed by 5oxo-MEHP and MEHP. Excretion in urine followed a multi-phase elimination model. After an absorption and distribution phase of 4 to 8 h, half-life times of excretion in the first elimination phase were approximately 2 h with slightly higher half-life times for 5OH- and 5oxo-MEHP. Half-life times in the second phase-beginning 14 to 18 h post dose-were 5 h for MEHP and 10 h for 5OH-MEHP and 5oxo-MEHP. In the time window 36 to 44 h, no decrease in excreted concentrations of 5OH- and 5oxo-MEHP was observed. In the first elimination phase (8 to 14 h post dose), mean excretion ratios of MEHP to 5oxo-MEHP and MEHP to 5OH-MEHP were 1 to 1.8 and 1 to 3.1. In the second elimination phase up to 24 h post dose mean excretion ratios of MEHP to 5oxo-MEHP to 5OH-MEHP were 1 to 5.0 to 9.3. The excretion ratio of 5OH-MEHP to 5oxo-MEHP remained constant through time at 1.7 in the mean. After 44 h, 47\% of the DEHP dose was excreted in urine, comprising MEHP (7.3\%), 5OH-MEHP (24.7\%) and 5oxo-MEHP (14.9\%).},

	abstract = {Human biomonitoring (HBM) of dose and biochemical effect nowadays has tremendous utility providing an efficient and cost effective means of measuring human exposure to chemical substances. HBM considers all routes of uptake and all sources which are relevant making it an ideal instrument for risk assessment and risk management. HBM can identify new chemical exposures, trends and changes in exposure, establish distribution of exposure among the general population, identify vulnerable groups and populations with higher exposures and identify environmental risks at specific contaminated sites with relatively low expenditure. The sensitivity of HBM methods moreover enables the elucidation of human metabolism and toxic mechanisms of the pollutants. So, HBM is a tool for scientists as well as for policy makers. Blood and urine are by far the most approved matrices. HBM can be done for most chemical substances which are in the focus of the worldwide discussion of environmental medicine. This especially applies for metals, PAH, phthalates, dioxins, pesticides, as well as for aromatic amines, perfluorinated chemicals, environmental tobacco smoke and volatile organic compounds. Protein adducts, especially Hb-adducts, as surrogates of DNA adducts measuring exposure as well as biochemical effect very specifically and sensitively are a still better means to estimate cancer risk than measuring genotoxic substances and their metabolites in human body fluids. Using very sophisticated but nevertheless routinely applicable analytical procedures Hb-adducts of alkylating agents, aromatic amines and nitro aromatic compounds are determined routinely today. To extend the spectrum of biochemical effect monitoring further methods should be elaborated which put up with cleavage and separation of the adducted protein molecules as a measure of sample preparation. This way all sites of adduction as well as further proteins, like serum albumin could be used for HBM. DNA-adducts indicate the mutagenicity of a chemical substance as well as an elevated cancer risk. DNA-adducts therefore would be ideal parameters for HBM. Though there are very sensitive techniques for DNA adduct monitoring like P32-postlabelling and immunological methods they lack specificity. For elucidating the mechanism of carcinogenesis and for a broad applicability and comparability in epidemiological studies analytical methods must be elaborated which are strictly specific for the chemical structure of the DNA-adduct. Current analytical possibilities however meet their borders. In HBM studies with exposure to genotoxic chemicals especially the measurement of DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in white blood cells has become very popular. However, there is still a lack of well-established dose-response relations between occupational or environmental exposures and the induction of 8-OHdG or formation of strand breaks which limits the applicability of these markers. Most of the biomarkers used in population studies are covered by standard operating procedures (SOPs) as well as by internal and external quality assessment schemes. Therefore, HBM results from the leading laboratories worldwide are analytically reliable and comparable. Newly upcoming substances of environmental relevance like perfluorinated compounds can rapidly be assessed in body fluids because there are very powerful laboratories which are able to elaborate the analytical prerequisites in due time. On the other hand, it is getting more and more difficult for the laboratories to keep up with a progress in instrumental analyses. In spite of this it will pay to reach the ultimate summit of HBM because it is the only way to identify and quantify human exposure and risk, elucidate the mechanism of toxic effects and to ultimately decide if measures have to be taken to reduce exposure. Risk assessment and risk management without HBM lead to wrong risk estimates and cause inadequate measures. In some countries like in USA and in Germany, thousands of inhabitants are regularly investigated with respect to their internal exposure to a broad range of environmentally occurring substances. For the evaluation of HBM results the German HBM Commission elaborates reference- and HBM-values.},

The dosed substances were deuterated di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (D(4)-DEHP) and di-isononylphthalate (D(4)-DINP) at two dose levels. Urine samples were collected at intervals up to 48 h post-dose. LC-MS/MS was used to measure metabolite concentrations. Excreted amounts were then calculated using urine volumes. Metabolite half-lives were estimated to be 4-8h with more than 90\% of metabolites in the first 24h of urine collections and the remainder in the 24-48 h period. The four metabolites of DEHP amounted to 47.1 ± 8.5\% fractional excretion on a molar basis. For DINP the identified metabolites totalled 32.9 ± 6.4\%. For both DEHP and DINP the metabolites were in the abundance order -monoester{\textless}-oxo{\textless}-carboxy{\textless}-hydroxy. These robust fractional excretion values for the main primary and secondary phthalate metabolites along with estimates of their uncertainty can be used in future surveys of human exposure to DEHP and DINP.},

	abstract = {Background: Post coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) condition is multifaceted with a heterogeneous clinical presentation. We aimed to identify distinct trajectories of the evolution of post COVID-19 condition, up to two years after symptom onset.Methods: The ComPaRe long COVID e-cohort is a nationwide prospective cohort of adult patients with symptoms lasting at least two months after SARS-CoV2 infection. We used trajectory modelling to identify different trajectories of the evolution of post COVID-19 condition, based on 53 self-reported symptoms collected every 60 days using the long COVID Symptom Tool. We used regression analyses to identify the clinical characteristics associated with each trajectory.Findings: A total of 2,197 patients were enrolled in the cohort between December 2020 and July 2022 (median age 46 years, interquartile range [IQR] 38–54 years; 79\% women and 69\% with laboratory- confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection). Three distinct trajectories of the evolution of post COVID-19 condition were identified: “high persistent symptoms” (4\%), “rapidly decreasing symptoms” (5\%), and “slowly decreasing symptoms” (91\%). Participants with high persistent symptoms were older and more likely to report a history of systemic diseases. They often reported tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations, and arrhythmia, paraesthesia or hot flushes. Participants with rapidly decreasing symptoms were younger and more likely to report a confirmed infection. They often reported diarrhoea and, neck, back, and/or low back pain. Participants with slowly decreasing symptoms were more likely to have functional diseases.Interpretation: Most of patients with post COVID-19 condition improve slowly over time, while 5\% have rapid improvement in the two years after symptom onset and 4\% have a persistent condition. Our results will help to better inform patients about their prognosis and warrant special focus on the response required by the healthcare system.Funding: The authors received no specific funding for this study.Declaration of Interest: The authors declare no competing interests or financial associations that may be relevant or seen as relevant to the submitted manuscriptEthical Approval: The Institutional Review Board of Hôtel-Dieu Hospital, Paris (IRB 0008367) approved the ComPaRe cohort.},

The US standardization demonstrated a single-factor structure and good to excellent psychometric properties. The cross-cultural validity of the German adaptation of the parent-report SRS in a sample of N=1,436 children and adolescents: 838 typically developing and 527 clinical participants (160 with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)) was examined. Internal consistency (0.91–0.97), test–retest reliability (0.84–0.97), interrater reliability (0.76 and 0.95) and convergent validity with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule as well as the Autism Diagnostic Interview—Revised and Social Communication Questionnaire (0.35–0.58) were satisfactory to good. The SRS total score discriminated between ASD and other mental disorders. SRS scores proved to be sufficiently independent of general psychopathology. Principal component analyses yielded single-factor solutions for the normative and clinical subsamples. In addition, construct validity was ensured by consistent correlations with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, the Child Behavior Checklist and the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory. Normative SRS total scores for girls and boys as well as values for ASD were lower in the German sample, while scores for conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity/conduct disorder combined were higher. Generally, cross-cultural validity of the SRS seems to be sufficiently assured for a large European sample. However, some discrepancies regarding SRS normative and clinical raw score distributions, reliability and validity findings are critically discussed.},

These phthalates are not tightly held by the plastics and are released into the environment over time. Congress is concerned about possible human health effects from exposure to six of these chemicals: di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP). DEHP, DBP, BBP, and (to less extent) DINP are known to be toxic to the reproductive systems of rodents. Recent experiments demonstrate that pre-natal exposure at a sufficient level to these same phthalates disrupts the normal action of hormones and can cause malformations of the reproductive organs of offspring (especially males).},

	abstract = {Phthalate esters (PEs) are by far the most produced and extensively used synthetic organic chemicals with notable applications in many industrial products such as vinyl upholstery, adhesives, food containers, packaging materials, printing inks, adhesives, cosmetics, paints, pharmaceuticals munitions, and insecticides among other. PEs have long been recognised as ubiquitous organic pollutants of prime environmental concern, with urbanisation amongst the main cause and source of these compounds. Due to their notoriety, these compounds are known to pose devastating effects to living organisms including humans. The presence of PEs and their metabolites in the aquatic ecosystems is of concern primarily due to their endocrine disrupting and carcinogenicity properties. Several research studies have reported prevalence, exposure pathways, toxicity, and impacts of PEs in aquatic ecosystems and humans. Their principal routes of exposure could be direct or indirect, of which the direct route include contact, eating, and drinking contaminated foods, and the indirect route constitute aerosols, leaching and other forms of environmental contamination. PEs find way into water systems through means such as effluent discharges, urban and agricultural land runoff, leaching from waste dumps and other diffuse sources. High-end instrumentation and improved methodologies on the other hand have resulted in increased ability to measure trace levels (μg/L) of PEs and their metabolites in different matrices and ecological compartments of water or aquatic ecosystems such as lakes, oceans, rivers, sediments, wetlands and drinking water samples. In light of the above, this article provides an informed and focused information on the prevalence of phthalate esters in aquatic systems and related effects on living organisms and humans. Furthermore, techniques that have enabled the extraction and analysis of these PEs in aquatic samples are also explained. Future research outlooks and needs are also highlighted in this manuscript. This information will be used to better understand their temporal and spatial distributions in the aquatic systems and aid in devising prudent means to curtail their ecological footprints.},

	abstract = {BACKDGROUND: Phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) have been used in a variety of consumer products and are detected widely in both humans and the environment. Demographic and socio-economic characteristics that affect exposure to these chemicals have been investigated among several general populations; however, nationally-representative population-based studies are limited to Canada, Germany, and the USA. Moreover, relatively little is known about the socio-demographic characteristics that influence exposure to these chemicals among nationally representative populations of Asia.
METHODS: Data are obtained from the Korean National Environmental Health Survey (2012-2014). In total, 6,478 adults (aged 19 and older) were recruited and sampled for urinary levels of major phthalate metabolites and bisphenol A. In addition, demographic and socio-economic parameters were determined from questionnaire data and the characteristics associated with urinary concentrations of the target chemicals were assessed.
RESULTS: Urinary levels of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) metabolites of Korean adults were generally higher, but those of mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) were lower, and BPA were similar or higher than those reported from national biomonitoring programs in the United States and Canada. Similar to other nationally representative populations, females and older adults showed higher creatinine-adjusted phthalate metabolite and BPA levels among the Korean population. Meanwhile, monthly household income and education were negatively associated with urinary phthalate metabolites. Among personal care products, nail polish use was positively associated with both phthalate metabolites and BPA concentrations in urine.
CONCLUSION: Our observations based on a nationally representative population of Korea show that socio-demographic determinants for these urinary chemicals vary by country, and should be considered for developing appropriate mitigation measures and policies.},

Through contact with such products, people are regularly exposed to phthalates, which are suspected to contribute to adverse health effects, particularly in the reproductive system. In the present study, 14 urinary phthalate metabolites of 10 parent phthalates were analysed by HPLC–MS/MS among the Austrian population aged 6–15 and 18–81 years in order to assess phthalate exposure. In the total study population, ranges of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations were n.d.–2,105μg/l (median 25μg/l) for monoethyl phthalate (MEP), n.d.–88μg/l (10μg/l) for mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), n.d.–248μg/l (28μg/l) for mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), n.d.–57μg/l (1.8μg/l) for mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), n.d.–20μg/l (n.d.) for mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), n.d.–80μg/l (2.6μg/l) for mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (5OH-MEHP), n.d.–57μg/l (1.9μg/l) for mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (5oxo-MEHP), n.d.–219μg/l (11μg/l) for mono-(5-carboxy-2-ethylpentyl) phthalate (5cx-MEPP), n.d.–188μg/l (1.6μg/l) for 3-carboxy-mono-proply phthalate (3cx-MPP), n.d.–5.5μg/l (n.d.) for mono-cyclohexyl phthalate (MCHP), n.d.–4.5μg/l (n.d.) for mono-n-pentyl phthalate (MnPeP), n.d.–3.4μg/l (n.d.) for mono-n-octyl phthalate (MnOP), n.d.–13μg/l (n.d.) for mono-isononyl phthalate (MiNP), and n.d.–1.1μg/l (n.d.) for mono-isodecyl phthalate (MiDP). Generally, children exhibited higher levels of exposure to the majority of investigated phthalates, except to MEP, which was found in higher concentrations in adults and senior citizens at a maximum concentration of 2,105μg/l. Individual daily intakes were estimated based on urinary creatinine and urinary volume excretion and were then compared to acceptable exposure levels, leading to the identification of exceedances of mainly the Tolerable Daily Intakes (TDI), especially among children. The execution of a cumulative risk assessment based on Hazard Indices showed cause for concern mainly for children, as well as in rare cases for adults. Although phthalate exposure seems to have decreased in previous years, the wide distribution and existing exceedances of acceptable levels indicate that phthalate exposure should be further monitored in order to identify exposure sources and enable appropriate minimisation measures.},

All metabolites could be detected in nearly all urine samples (N=599). Descriptive data analysis leads to mean concentrations of 5-OH-MEHP and 5-oxo-MEHP of 48microg/l and 37microg/l, respectively. The mean concentration of 7OH-MMeOP was 11microg/l. MnBP, MiNP, MBzP showed mean levels of 96microg/l, 94microg/l, and 18microg/l, respectively. The concentrations of the phthalate metabolites decreased with increasing age. Compared to German adults all children showed three to five fold higher urine concentrations than adults analysed in the same decade. For some children the levels of the sum of 5OH-MEHP and 5oxo-MEHP in urine were higher than the German human biomonitoring value (HBM I) of 500mcirog/l, which indicates that adverse health effects cannot be excluded for these subjects with sufficient certainty. The mean concentration of BPA in urine was 2.7microg/l. A rough calculation of the daily intakes on the basis of the measured concentrations in urine resulted in daily intakes two orders of magnitude lower than the current EFSA reference dose of 50microg/kgbw/d.},

	abstract = {Biologic monitoring (i.e., biomonitoring) is used to assess human exposures to environmental and workplace chemicals. Urinary biomonitoring data typically are adjusted to a constant creatinine concentration to correct for variable dilutions among spot samples. Traditionally, this approach has been used in population groups without much diversity. The inclusion of multiple demographic groups in studies using biomonitoring for exposure assessment has increased the variability in the urinary creatinine levels in these study populations. Our objectives were to document the normal range of urinary creatinine concentrations among various demographic groups, evaluate the impact that variations in creatinine concentrations can have on classifying exposure status of individuals in epidemiologic studies, and recommend an approach using multiple regression to adjust for variations in creatinine in multivariate analyses. We performed a weighted multivariate analysis of urinary creatinine concentrations in 22,245 participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) and established reference ranges (10th-90th percentiles) for each demographic and age category. Significant predictors of urinary creatinine concentration included age group, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and fat-free mass. Time of day that urine samples were collected made a small but statistically significant difference in creatinine concentrations. For an individual, the creatinine-adjusted concentration of an analyte should be compared with a "reference" range derived from persons in a similar demographic group (e.g., children with children, adults with adults). For multiple regression analysis of population groups, we recommend that the analyte concentration (unadjusted for creatinine) should be included in the analysis with urinary creatinine added as a separate independent variable. This approach allows the urinary analyte concentration to be appropriately adjusted for urinary creatinine and the statistical significance of other variables in the model to be independent of effects of creatinine concentration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: For Europe as a whole, data on internal exposure to environmental chemicals do not yet exist. Characterization of the internal individual chemical environment is expected to enhance understanding of the environmental threats to health.
OBJECTIVES: We developed and applied a harmonized protocol to collect comparable human biomonitoring data all over Europe.
METHODS: In 17 European countries, we measured mercury in hair and cotinine, phthalate metabolites, and cadmium in urine of 1,844 children (5-11 years of age) and their mothers. Specimens were collected over a 5-month period in 2011-2012. We obtained information on personal characteristics, environment, and lifestyle. We used the resulting database to compare concentrations of exposure biomarkers within Europe, to identify determinants of exposure, and to compare exposure biomarkers with health-based guidelines.
RESULTS: Biomarker concentrations showed a wide variability in the European population. However, levels in children and mothers were highly correlated. Most biomarker concentrations were below the health-based guidance values.
CONCLUSIONS: We have taken the first steps to assess personal chemical exposures in Europe as a whole. Key success factors were the harmonized protocol development, intensive training and capacity building for field work, chemical analysis and communication, as well as stringent quality control programs for chemical and data analysis. Our project demonstrates the feasibility of a Europe-wide human biomonitoring framework to support the decision-making process of environmental measures to protect public health.},

	abstract = {The metabolism of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) in humans was studied after three doses of 0.35 mg (4.7 microg/kg), 2.15 mg (28.7 microg/kg) and 48.5 mg (650 microg/kg) of D4-ring-labelled DEHP were administered orally to a male volunteer. Two new metabolites, mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl)phthalate (5cx-MEPP) and mono[2-(carboxymethyl)hexyl]phthalate (2cx-MMHP) were monitored for 44 h in urine and for 8 h in serum for the high-dose case, in addition to the three metabolites previously analysed: mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)phthalate (5OH-MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl)phthalate (5oxo-MEHP) and mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP). For the medium- and low-dose cases, 24 h urine samples were analysed. Up to 12 h after the dose, 5OH-MEHP was the major urinary metabolite, after 12 h it was 5cx-MEPP, and after 24 h it was 2cx-MMHP. The elimination half-lives of 5cx-MEHP and 2cx-MMHP were between 15 and 24 h. After 24 h 67.0\% (range: 65.8-70.5\%) of the DEHP dose was excreted in urine, comprising 5OH-MEHP (23.3\%), 5cx-MEPP (18.5\%), 5oxo-MEHP (15.0\%), MEHP (5.9\%) and 2cx-MMHP (4.2\%). An additional 3.8\% of the DEHP dose was excreted on the second day, comprising 2cx-MMHP (1.6\%), 5cx-MEPP (1.2\%), 5OH-MEHP (0.6\%) and 5oxo-MEHP (0.4\%). In total about 75\% of the administered DEHP dose was excreted in urine after two days. Therefore, in contrast to previous studies, most of the orally administered DEHP is systemically absorbed and excreted in urine. No dose dependency in metabolism and excretion was observed. The secondary metabolites of DEHP are superior biomonitoring markers compared to any other parameters, such as MEHP in urine or blood. 5OH-MEHP and 5oxo-MEHP in urine reflect short-term and 5cx-MEHP and 2cx-MMHP long-term exposure. All secondary metabolites are unsusceptible to contamination. Furthermore, there are strong hints that the secondary oxidised DEHP metabolites-not DEHP or MEHP-are the ultimate developmental toxicants.},

	abstract = {Phthalates are synthetic compounds widely used as plasticisers, solvents and additives in many consumer products. Several animal studies have shown that some phthalates possess endocrine disrupting effects. Some of the effects of phthalates seen in rats are due to testosterone lowering effects on the foetal testis and they are similar to those seen in humans with testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Therefore, exposure of the human foetus and infants to phthalates via maternal exposure is a matter of concern. The metabolic pathways of phthalate metabolites excreted in human urine are partly known for some phthalates, but our knowledge about metabolic distribution in the body and other biological fluids, including breast milk, is limited. Compared to urine, human breast milk contains relatively more of the hydrophobic phthalates, such as di-n-butyl phthalate and the longer-branched, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-iso-nonyl phthalate (DiNP); and their monoester metabolites. Urine, however, contains relatively more of the secondary metabolites of DEHP and DiNP, as well as the monoester phthalates of the more short-branched phthalates. This differential distribution is of special concern as, in particular, the hydrophobic phthalates and their metabolites are shown to have adverse effects following in utero and lactational exposures in animal studies.},

	abstract = {Phthalates are ubiquitous in our modern environment because of their use in plastics and cosmetic products. Phthalate monoesters--primarily monoethylhexyl phthalate and monobutyl phthalate--are reproductive and developmental toxicants in animals. Accurate measures of phthalate exposure are needed to assess their human health effects. Phthalate monoesters have a biologic half-life of approximately 12 hr, and little is known about the temporal variability and daily reproducibility of urinary measures in humans. To explore these aspects, we measured seven phthalate monoesters and creatinine concentration in two consecutive first-morning urine specimens from 46 African-American women, ages 35-49 years, residing in the Washington, DC, area in 1996-1997. We measured phthalate monoesters using high-pressure liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole instrument using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. We detected four phthalate monoesters in all subjects, with median levels of 31 ng/mL for monobenzyl phthalate (mBzP), 53 ng/mL for monobutyl phthalate (mBP), 211 ng/mL for monoethyl phthalate (mEP), and 7.3 ng/mL for monoethylhexyl phthalate (mEHP). These were similar to concentrations reported for other populations using spot urine specimens. Phthalate levels did not differ between the two sampling days. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the concentrations on the 2 days was 0.8 for mBP, 0.7 for mEHP, 0.6 for mEP, and 0.5 for mBzP. These results suggest that even with the short half-lives of phthalates, women's patterns of exposure may be sufficiently stable to assign an exposure level based on a single first morning void urine measurement.},

The observed BPA migration levels were found to be nearly independent of the concentration of residual BPA in the PC resins. Hydrolysis of PC is the dominant mechanism responsible for the release of BPA from the polymer surface into the contacting aqueous liquid. Experiments with PC spiked with deuterated BPA revealed that diffusion-controlled migration play a minor role in the overall release of BPA from PC. The influence of a number of experimental parameters on the migration of BPA into aqueous liquids was studied. Factors found to be of importance included the temperature, pH, and ozone concentration of the liquids, as well as the surface ageing of the PC. All of the BPA migration levels obtained from experiments performed under standard conditions as given in the EU legislation and its associated guidance documents were found to be well below the EU specific migration limit of 600 μg/kg food which applies to plastics in contact with foodstuffs (EU Directive 2002/72/EC as amended).

BPA was determined by GC-MS, operated in the selected ion monitoring mode. The concentrations of BPA, migrated from brand-new PC baby bottle, were 0.03ppb and 0.13ppb at 40 degrees C and 95 degrees C, respectively. However, the concentration of BPA from the bottle used for 6months, were 0.18ppb and 18.47ppb at 40 degrees C and 95 degrees C, respectively. The levels of BPA migration were rapidly increased when the water temperature was over 80 degrees C. The variations of BPA level were divided into three regions; lag effect, steady and aging, which showed different increasing rate. PC baby bottle after being utilized 60 times which was correspond to the baby bottle used for 3months started aging. It also showed an increasing rate of 4.9x10(-2)ppbtime(-1). These results are explained by increase in d-spacing of PC baby bottle. The d-spacing of PC baby bottle increases with repeated use from 0.499nm in brand-new bottles to 0.511nm with bottles which had been used for 6months.},

Until recently, there were relatively few epidemiological studies examining the relationship between BPA and health effects in humans. However, in the last year, the number of these studies has more than doubled. A comprehensive literature search found 91 studies linking BPA to human health; 53 published within the last year. This review outlines this body of literature, showing associations between BPA exposure and adverse perinatal, childhood, and adult health outcomes, including reproductive and developmental effects, metabolic disease, and other health effects. These studies encompass both prenatal and postnatal exposures, and include several study designs and population types. While it is difficult to make causal links with epidemiological studies, the growing human literature correlating environmental BPA exposure to adverse effects in humans, along with laboratory studies in many species including primates, provides increasing support that environmental BPA exposure can be harmful to humans, especially in regards to behavioral and other effects in children.},

This is a step in the right direction because mediation analyses based on nonexperimental data are likely to be biased and because experiments, in principle, provide a sound basis for causal inference.

The authors describe 3 of these threats and suggest ways to improve the exposition and design of mediation tests. Their conclusion is that inference about mediators is far more difficult than previous research suggests and is best tackled by an experimental research program that is specifically designed to address the challenges of mediation analysis.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of separating the direct effects of an exposure from effects relayed through an intermediate variable (indirect effects). We show that adjustment for the intermediate variable, which is the most common method of estimating direct effects, can be biased. We also show that, even in a randomized crossover trial of exposure, direct and indirect effects cannot be separated without special assumptions; in other words, direct and indirect effects are not separately identifiable when only exposure is randomized. If the exposure and intermediate never interact to cause disease and if intermediate effects can be controlled, that is, blocked by a suitable intervention, then a trial randomizing both exposure and the intervention can separate direct from indirect effects. Nonetheless, the estimation must be carried out using the G-computation algorithm. Conventional adjustment methods remain biased. When exposure and the intermediate interact to cause disease, direct and indirect effects will not be separable even in a trial in which both the exposure and the intervention blocking intermediate effects are randomly assigned. Nonetheless, in such a trial, one can still estimate the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate. Even in the absence of an intervention blocking the intermediate effect, the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate can be estimated with the G-computation algorithm if data are obtained on additional confounding variables.

	abstract = {L'analyse de médiation à haute dimension est une extension de l'analyse de médiation unidimensionnelle qui inclut plusieurs médiateurs et est de plus en plus utilisée en épidémiologie environnementale pour évaluer les effets épigénétiques indirects des expositions environnementales sur les résultats de santé. Cependant, les analyses impliquant des données de grande dimension soulèvent plusieurs problèmes statistiques. Bien que de nombreuses méthodes aient été récemment développées pour résoudre ces problèmes, aucun consensus n'a été atteint sur une combinaison optimale d'approches. Pour mieux appréhender la problématique de médiation en haute dimension, le premier chapitre de thèse ce focalise sur les études d’associations tel que les EWAS et les GWAS. Les associations de phénotypes ou d'expositions avec des données génomiques et épigénomiques se heurte à d'importants défis statistiques. L'un de ces défis consiste à tenir compte de la variation due à des facteurs de confusion non observés, tels que l'ascendance individuelle ou la composition du type cellulaire dans les tissus. Ce problème peut être résolu avec des modèles de régression à facteurs latents pénalisés, où des pénalités sont introduites pour faire face à une dimension enlevée dans les données. Si une proportion relativement faible de marqueurs génomiques ou épigénomiques est corrélée à la variable d'intérêt, les pénalités de parcimonie (sparse) peuvent aider à capturer les associations pertinentes, mais l'amélioration par rapport aux approches non parcimonieuses n'a pas encore été entièrement évaluée. Ici, nous présentons un algorithme des moindres carrés qui estime conjointement les tailles d'effet et les facteurs de confusion dans des modèles de régression à facteurs latents parcimonieux (sparse). Cet algorithme a pu être validé dans un contexte de simulation. Nous avons appliqué notre méthode à une étude d'association à l'échelle du génome d'un trait de floraison de la plante Arabidopsis thaliana et à une étude d'association à l'échelle de l'épigénome du statut tabagique chez les femmes enceintes. Pour les deux applications, les modèles de régression à facteurs latents parcimonieux ont facilité l'estimation des tailles d'effet non nulles tout en surmontant les problèmes de tests multiples. Les résultats étaient non seulement cohérents avec les découvertes précédentes, mais ils ont également identifié de nouveaux gènes avec des annotations fonctionnelles pertinentes pour chaque application. Dans le second chapitre, nous avons développé HDMAX2, une nouvelle approche en plusieurs étapes de médiation qui combine des modèles de régression des facteurs latents pour les études d'association à l'échelle de l'épigénome avec des tests de médiation (test du maximum au carré). HDMAX2 à été́ soigneusement évaluée à partir de simulations et comparée à des méthodes de médiation en haute dimension. Ensuite, HDMAX2 a été utilisé pour évaluer les effets indirects de l'exposition au tabagisme maternel sur le poids à la naissance à terme et l'âge gestationnel à l'accouchement dans une étude portant sur 470 femmes de la cohorte mère enfant EDEN. HDMAX2 a permis de détecter des régions non identifiées dans les analyses de médiation précédentes de l'exposition au tabagisme sur le poids de naissance. Les résultats ont fourni des preuves d'une architecture polygénique de la voie causale avec un effet indirect global de 44 g de poids corporel inférieur (31 \% de la taille de l'effet total). HDMAX2 a également identifié des régions ayant des effets simultanés à la fois sur l’âge gestationnel et sur le poids de naissance. Parmi les principaux résultats des analyses de l’âge gestationnel et du poids de naissance, les régions situées sur les gènes COASY et BLCAP ont également médié la relation entre l’âge gestationnel et le poids de naissance, suggérant une causalité inverse dans la relation entre l’âge gestationnel et le méthylome.},

	abstract = {L'analyse de médiation causale est une méthode statistique permettant d'étudier les mécanismes définissant les relations entre trois entités, la première étant une cause, la deuxième une variable de réponse et la troisième un ensemble de variables intermédiaires, aussi appelés médiateurs. Cette approche est devenue populaire dans différents domaines tels que les biostatistiques, l'épidémiologie et les sciences sociales. Son objectif est de décomposer et quantifier l'effet total d'une cause T sur une variable de réponse Y en un effet direct et un effet indirect à travers le(s)médiateur(s) Mi. Dans un diagramme causal ainsi défini peuvent intervenir des covariables mesurées ou non ayant des effets sur les trois variables T, Y et Mi. Quand plusieurs médiateurs sont impliqués dans le modèle de médiation, il y a trois cas possibles de relation entre ces médiateurs : 1) Les médiateurs sont indépendants conditionnellement au traitement et aux covariables mesurées. 2) Les médiateurs sont dépendants conditionnellement au traitement et aux covariables mesurées sans pour autant que l'un affecte l'autre. 3) Les médiateurs sont liés de façon causale, c'est-à-dire que l'un affecte l'autre. Les contributions de cette thèse portent sur les deux premières configurations. Plus particulièrement, l'état de l'art pour l'estimation des effets indirects individuels des médiateurs est de faire plusieurs analyses de médiation simple en parallèle, un médiateur à la fois. Cette approche conduit à une estimation biaisée de l'effet direct et n'est pas justifiée dans la situation 2) car l'hypothèse nécessaire d'Ignorabilité Séquentielle n'est alors pas vérifiée. Le premier chapitre de la thèse propose de résoudre ce problème par l'estimation de la loi multivariée des médiateurs conditionnellement au traitement et décrit les nouvelles hypothèses sous lesquelles une telle approche est valide. Une méthode d'estimation de l'effet direct et de tous les effets indirects individuels est développée, prenant en compte la corrélation entre les médiateurs. Le second chapitre est dédié à l'analyse de médiation multiple2/6dans le cas où le nombre de médiateurs grandit. Deux stratégies sont explorées. La première repose sur une classification spectrale des médiateurs en blocs indépendants, chaque bloc pouvant être analysé avec l'approche précédente. La seconde, applicable dans des problèmes de grande dimension, repose sur la sélection de médiateurs potentiels à l'aide d'une approche de type Group-LASSO en amont de l'analyse de médiation. Le troisième chapitre présente le packageR multimediate où les trois méthodes précédentes sont implémentées. On y présente l'algorithme d'estimation en fonction des différents types de médiateurs considérés (linéaires, binaires et catégoriels). Le dernier chapitre présente des applications sur des données réelles. D'une part une application en épidémiologie pour quantifier et décomposer l'effet de la thérapie hormonal sur le cancer du sein. D'autre part une application en psychiatrie, où nous analysons les effets des tempéraments affectifs sur l'anorexie mentale},

	abstract = {Childhood internalizing disorders refer to inwardly focused negative behaviours such as anxiety, depression, and somatic complains. Interactions between psychosocial, genetic, and environmental risk factors adversely impact neurodevelopment and can contribute to internalizing disorders. While prenatal exposure to single endocrine disruptors (EDs) is associated with internalizing behaviours in infants, the associations with prenatal exposure to EDs in mixture remain poorly addressed. In addition, the biological mediators of EDs in mixture effects on internalizing behaviours remain unexplored. EDs do not only interfere with endocrine function, but also with immune function and inflammatory processes. Based on this body of evidence, we hypothetised that inflammation at birth is a plausible biological pathway through which prenatal exposure to EDs in mixture could operate to influence offspring internalizing behaviours. Based on the EDEN birth cohort, we investigated whether exposure to a mixture of EDs increased the odds of internalizing disorders in 459 boy infants at age 3, and whether the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α measured at birth were mediators of this effect. To determine both the joint and individual associations of prenatal exposure to EDs with infant internalizing behaviours and the possible mediating role of cytokines, we used the counterfactual hierarchical Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) regression-causal mediation analysis. We show that prenatal exposure to a complex mixture of EDs has limited effects on internalizing behaviours in boys at age 3. We also show that IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α are unlikely mediators or suppressors of ED mixture effects on internalizing behaviours in boys at age 3. Further studies on larger cohorts are warranted to refine the deleterious effects of EDs in mixtures on internalizing behaviours and identify possible mediating pathways.},

	abstract = {The book provides an accessible but comprehensive overview of methods for mediation and interaction. There has been considerable and rapid methodological development on mediation and moderation/interaction analysis within the causal-inference literature over the last ten years. Much of this material appears in a variety of specialized journals, and some of the papers are quite technical. There has also been considerable interest in these developments from empirical researchers in the social and biomedical sciences. However, much of the material is not currently in a format that is accessible to them. The book closes these gaps by providing an accessible, comprehensive, book-length coverage of mediation. The book begins with a comprehensive introduction to mediation analysis, including chapters on concepts for mediation, regression-based methods, sensitivity analysis, time-to-event outcomes, methods for multiple mediators, methods for time-varying mediation and longitudinal data, and relations between mediation and other concepts involving intermediates such as surrogates, principal stratification, instrumental variables, and Mendelian randomization. The second part of the book concerns interaction or "moderation," including concepts for interaction, statistical interaction, confounding and interaction, mechanistic interaction, bias analysis for interaction, interaction in genetic studies, and power and sample-size calculation for interaction. The final part of the book provides comprehensive discussion about the relationships between mediation and interaction and unites these concepts within a single framework. This final part also provides an introduction to spillover effects orsocial interaction, concluding with a discussion of social-network analyses. The book is written to be accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of statistics. Comprehensive appendices provide more technical details for the interested reader. Applied empirical examples from a variety of fields are given throughout. Software implementation in SAS, Stata, SPSS, and R is provided. The book should be accessible to students and researchers who have completed a first-year graduate sequence in quantitative methods in one of the social- or biomedical-sciences disciplines. The book will only presuppose familiarity with linear and logistic regression, and could potentially be used as an advanced undergraduate book as well.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in the causal inference literature on mediation have extended traditional approaches to direct and indirect effects to settings that allow for interactions and non-linearities. In this paper, these approaches from causal inference are further extended to settings in which multiple mediators may be of interest. Two analytic approaches, one based on regression and one based on weighting are proposed to estimate the effect mediated through multiple mediators and the effects through other pathways. The approaches proposed here accommodate exposuremediator interactions and, to a certain extent, mediator-mediator interactions as well. The methods handle binary or continuous mediators and binary, continuous or count outcomes. When the mediators affect one another, the strategy of trying to assess direct and indirect effects one mediator at a time will in general fail; the approach given in this paper can still be used. A characterization is moreover given as to when the sum of the mediated effects for multiple mediators considered separately will be equal to the mediated effect of all of the mediators considered jointly. The approach proposed in this paper is robust to unmeasured common causes of two or more mediators.},

	abstract = {The overall effect of an exposure on an outcome, in the presence of a mediator with which the exposure may interact, can be decomposed into 4 components: (1) the effect of the exposure in the absence of the mediator, (2) the interactive effect when the mediator is left to what it would be in the absence of exposure, (3) a mediated interaction, and (4) a pure mediated effect. These 4 components, respectively, correspond to the portion of the effect that is due to neither mediation nor interaction, to just interaction (but not mediation), to both mediation and interaction, and to just mediation (but not interaction). This 4-way decomposition unites methods that attribute effects to interactions and methods that assess mediation. Certain combinations of these 4 components correspond to measures for mediation, whereas other combinations correspond to measures of interaction previously proposed in the literature. Prior decompositions in the literature are in essence special cases of this 4-way decomposition. The 4-way decomposition can be carried out using standard statistical models, and software is provided to estimate each of the 4 components. The 4-way decomposition provides maximum insight into how much of an effect is mediated, how much is due to interaction, how much is due to both mediation and interaction together, and how much is due to neither.},

The guideline development process included (1) an overview of systematic reviews to assess the need for a reporting guideline; (2) review of systematic reviews of relevant evidence on reporting mediation analyses; (3) conducting a Delphi survey with panel members that included methodologists, statisticians, clinical trialists, epidemiologists, psychologists, applied clinical researchers, clinicians, implementation scientists, evidence synthesis experts, representatives from the EQUATOR Network, and journal editors (n = 19; June-November 2019); (4) having a consensus meeting (n = 15; April 28-29, 2020); and (5) conducting a 4-week external review and pilot test that included methodologists and potential users of AGReMA (n = 21; November 2020).A previously reported overview of 54 systematic reviews of mediation studies demonstrated the need for a reporting guideline. Thirty-three potential reporting items were identified from 3 systematic reviews of mediation studies. Over 3 rounds, the Delphi panelists ranked the importance of these items, provided 60 qualitative comments for item refinement and prioritization, and suggested new items for consideration. All items were reviewed during a 2-day consensus meeting and participants agreed on a 25-item AGReMA statement for studies in which mediation analyses are the primary focus and a 9-item short-form AGReMA statement for studies in which mediation analyses are a secondary focus. These checklists were externally reviewed and pilot tested by 21 expert methodologists and potential users, which led to minor adjustments and consolidation of the checklists.The AGReMA statement provides recommendations for reporting primary and secondary mediation analyses of randomized trials and observational studies. Improved reporting of studies that use mediation analyses could facilitate peer review and help produce publications that are complete, accurate, transparent, and reproducible.},

Such models are related to and compared with other analytic approaches often used in epidemiology, including regression analysis, causal diagrams, causal mediation analysis, and marginal structural models. Several of these other approaches in fact developed out of the SEM literature. However, SEMs themselves tend to make much stronger assumptions than these other techniques. SEMs estimate more types of effects than do these other techniques, but this comes at the price of additional assumptions. Many of these assumptions have often been ignored and not carefully evaluated when SEMs have been used in practice. In light of the strong assumptions employed by SEMs, the author argues that they should be used principally for the purposes of exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation when a broad range of effects are potentially of interest.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of separating the direct effects of an exposure from effects relayed through an intermediate variable (indirect effects). We show that adjustment for the intermediate variable, which is the most common method of estimating direct effects, can be biased. We also show that even in a randomized crossover trial of exposure, direct and indirect effects cannot be separated without special assumptions; in other words, direct and indirect effects are not separately identifiable when only exposure is randomized. If the exposure and intermediate never interact to cause disease and if intermediate effects can be controlled, that is, blocked by a suitable intervention, then a trial randomizing both exposure and the intervention can separate direct from indirect effects. Nonetheless, the estimation must be carried out using the G-computation algorithm. Conventional adjustment methods remain biased. When exposure and the intermediate interact to cause disease, direct and indirect effects will not be separable even in a trial in which both the exposure and the intervention blocking intermediate effects are randomly assigned. Nonetheless, in such a trial, one can still estimate the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate. Even in the absence of an intervention blocking the intermediate effect, the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate can be estimated with the G-computation algorithm if data are obtained on additional confounding variables.},

	abstract = {Greater understanding of the pathways through which an environmental mixture operates is important to design effective interventions. We present new methodology to estimate natural direct and indirect effects and controlled direct effects of a complex mixture exposure on an outcome through a mediator variable. We implement Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) to allow for all possible interactions and nonlinear effects of (1) the co-exposures on the mediator, (2) the co-exposures and mediator on the outcome, and (3) selected covariates on the mediator and/or outcome. From the posterior predictive distributions of the mediator and outcome, we simulate counterfactuals to obtain posterior samples, estimates, and credible intervals of the mediation effects. Our simulation study demonstrates that when the exposure-mediator and exposure-mediator-outcome relationships are complex, BKMR-Causal Mediation Analysis performs better than current mediation methods. We applied our methodology to quantify the contribution of birth length as a mediator between in utero co-exposure to arsenic, manganese, and lead, and children's neurodevelopmental scores, in a prospective birth cohort in Bangladesh. Among younger children, we found a negative (adverse) association between the metal mixture and neurodevelopment. We also found evidence that birth length mediates the effect of exposure to the metal mixture on neurodevelopment for younger children. If birth length were fixed to its 75th percentile value, the harmful effect of the metal mixture on neurodevelopment is attenuated, suggesting nutritional interventions to help increase fetal growth, and thus birth length, could potentially block the harmful effect of the metal mixture on neurodevelopment.},

	abstract = {Mediation analysis investigates the intermediate mechanism through which an exposure exerts its inﬂuence on the outcome of interest. Mediation analysis is becoming increasingly popular in high-throughput genomics studies where a common goal is to identify molecular-level traits, such as gene expression or methylation, which actively mediate the genetic or environmental effects on the outcome. Mediation analysis in genomics studies is particularly challenging, however, thanks to the large number of potential mediators measured in these studies as well as the composite null nature of the mediation effect hypothesis. Indeed, while the standard univariate and multivariate mediation methods have been wellestablished for analyzing one or multiple mediators, they are not well-suited for genomics studies with a large number of mediators and often yield conservative p-values and limited power. Consequently, over the past few years many new high-dimensional mediation methods have been developed for analyzing the large number of potential mediators collected in high-throughput genomics studies. In this work, we present a thorough review of these important recent methodological advances in high-dimensional mediation analysis. Speciﬁcally, we describe in detail more than ten high-dimensional mediation methods, focusing on their motivations, basic modeling ideas, speciﬁc modeling assumptions, practical successes, methodological limitations, as well as future directions. We hope our review will serve as a useful guidance for statisticians and computational biologists who develop methods of highdimensional mediation analysis as well as for analysts who apply mediation methods to highthroughput genomics studies.},

A predominant approach has been to use linear structural equation models and examine the statistical significance of the corresponding path coefficients. However, this approach implicitly assumes that the multiple mechanisms are causally independent of one another. In this article, we consider a set of alternative assumptions that are sufficient to identify the average causal mediation effects when multiple, causally related mediators exist. We develop a new sensitivity analysis for examining the robustness of empirical findings to the potential violation of a key identification assumption. We apply the proposed methods to three political psychology experiments, which examine alternative causal pathways between media framing and public opinion. Our analysis reveals that the validity of original conclusions is highly reliant on the assumed independence of alternative causal mechanisms, highlighting the importance of proposed sensitivity analysis.

We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general deﬁnition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identiﬁcation assumption, and the difﬁculty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the deﬁnition, identiﬁcation, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any speciﬁc statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general deﬁnition and identiﬁcation result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.},

	abstract = {Causal mediation analysis is routinely conducted by applied researchers in a variety of disciplines. The goal of such an analysis is to investigate alternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables that lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In this paper we ﬁrst prove that under a particular version of sequential ignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is nonparametrically identiﬁed. We compare our identiﬁcation assumption with those proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our identiﬁcation result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator based on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an ACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that these assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM framework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be easily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the existing identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability assumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity analysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical ﬁndings to the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology. We also make easy-to-use software available to implement the proposed methods.},

Typically the aim is to identify the total effect of the exposure on the outcome, the effect of the exposure that acts through a given set of mediators of interest (indirect effect) and the effect of the exposure unexplained by those same mediators (direct effect). The traditional approach to mediation analysis is based on adjusting for the mediator in standard regression models to estimate the direct effect. However, several methodological papers have shown that under a number of circumstances this traditional approach may produce flawed conclusions. Through a better understanding of the causal structure of the variables involved in the analysis, with a formal definition of direct and indirect effects in a counterfactual framework, alternative analytical methods have been introduced to improve the validity and interpretation of mediation analysis. In this paper, we review and discuss the impact of the three main sources of potential bias in the traditional approach to mediation analyses: (i) mediator-outcome confounding;(ii) exposure-mediator interaction and (iii) mediator-outcome confounding affected by the exposure. We provide examples and discuss the impact these sources have in terms of bias.},

	abstract = {In diverse fields of empirical research-including many in the biological sciences-attempts are made to decompose the effect of an exposure on an outcome into its effects via a number of different pathways. For example, we may wish to separate the effect of heavy alcohol consumption on systolic blood pressure (SBP) into effects via body mass index (BMI), via gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and via other pathways. Much progress has been made, mainly due to contributions from the field of causal inference, in understanding the precise nature of statistical estimands that capture such intuitive effects, the assumptions under which they can be identified, and statistical methods for doing so. These contributions have focused almost entirely on settings with a single mediator, or a set of mediators considered en bloc; in many applications, however, researchers attempt a much more ambitious decomposition into numerous path-specific effects through many mediators. In this article, we give counterfactual definitions of such path-specific estimands in settings with multiple mediators, when earlier mediators may affect later ones, showing that there are many ways in which decomposition can be done. We discuss the strong assumptions under which the effects are identified, suggesting a sensitivity analysis approach when a particular subset of the assumptions cannot be justified. These ideas are illustrated using data on alcohol consumption, SBP, BMI, and GGT from the Izhevsk Family Study. We aim to bridge the gap from "single mediator theory" to "multiple mediator practice," highlighting the ambitious nature of this endeavor and giving practical suggestions on how to proceed.},

	abstract = {Natural direct and indirect effects formalize traditional notions of mediation analysis into a rigorous causal framework and have recently received considerable attention in epidemiology and in the social sciences. Sufficient conditions for identification of natural direct effects were formulated by Judea Pearl under a nonparametric structural equations model, which assumes certain independencies between potential outcomes. A common situation in epidemiology is that a confounder of the mediator-outcome relationship is itself affected by the exposure, in which case natural direct effects fail to be nonparametrically identified without additional assumptions, even under Pearl's nonparametric structural equations model. In this paper, we show that when a single binary confounder of the mediator is affected by the exposure, the natural direct effect is nonparametrically identified under the model, assuming monotonicity about the effect of the exposure on the confounder. A similar result is shown to hold for a vector of binary confounders of the mediator under a certain independence assumption about the confounders. Finally, we show that natural direct effects are more generally identified if there is no additive mean interaction between the mediator and confounders of the mediator affected by exposure. When correct, this latter assumption is particularly appealing because it does not require monotonicity of effects of the exposure. Additionally, it places no restriction on the nature of the confounders of the mediator which can be continuous or polytomous.},

We show that these allow for effect decomposition under weaker identification conditions than population natural direct and indirect effects. When no confounders of the mediator-outcome association are affected by the exposure, identification is possible under essentially the same conditions as for controlled direct effects. Otherwise, identification is still possible with additional knowledge on a nonidentifiable selection-bias function which measures the dependence of the mediator effect on the observed exposure within confounder levels, and which evaluates to zero in a large class of realistic data-generating mechanisms. We argue that natural direct and indirect effects on the exposed are of intrinsic interest in various applications. We moreover show that they coincide with the corresponding population natural direct and indirect effects when the exposure is randomly assigned. In such settings, our results are thus also of relevance for assessing population natural direct and indirect effects in the presence of exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounding, which existing methodology has not been able to address.},

The first school is linked to path analysis and structural equation models (SEMs), while the second is related mostly to methods developed within the potential outcomes approach to causal inference. By giving model-free definitions of direct and indirect effects and clear assumptions for their identification, the latter school has formalized notions intuitively developed in the former and has greatly increased the flexibility of the models involved. However, through its predominant focus on nonparametric identification, the causal inference approach to effect decomposition via natural effects is limited to settings that exclude intermediate confounders. Such confounders are naturally dealt with (albeit with the caveats of informality and modeling inflexibility) in the SEM framework. Therefore, it seems pertinent to revisit SEMs with intermediate confounders, armed with the formal definitions and (parametric) identification assumptions from causal inference. Here we investigate: 1) how identification assumptions affect the specification of SEMs, 2) whether the more restrictive SEM assumptions can be relaxed, and 3) whether existing sensitivity analyses can be extended to this setting.

Maternal estradiol levels were negatively associated with BASC-3 Clinical Probability scores among males (n = 139). We report a significant interaction effect of cord blood testosterone and fetal sex on both total SCQ scores and t-scores on the Developmental Social Disorders subscale. Placental aromatase was not associated with any neurodevelopmental or hormone measure, but under conditions of low placental aromatase expression, high maternal testosterone was positively associated with SCQ scores in males (n = 46). No other associations between hormone levels and neurodevelopment were significant.

These changes are important for the transition to postnatal life. Exposure of the fetus to increased levels of glucocorticoids, resulting from maternal stress or treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids, can lead to long-term 'programming' of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function and behaviours. Glucocorticoids act at multiple levels within the fetal brain. Growing evidence indicates that they can exert powerful effects on the epigenome, including on DNA methylation, histone acetylation and microRNA, to influence gene expression. Such influences probably represent a critical component of the 'programming' process, and might be partly responsible for the transgenerational effects of antenatal glucocorticoid exposure on neurologic, cardiovascular and metabolic function.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We previously reported the results of a randomized, controlled trial showing that repeat doses of antenatal corticosteroids reduced the risk of respiratory distress syndrome and serious neonatal morbidity. However, data have not been available regarding longer-term effects of this treatment.
METHODS: Women who had received an initial course of corticosteroid treatment 7 or more days previously were randomly assigned to receive an intramuscular injection of corticosteroid (11.4 mg of betamethasone) or saline placebo; the dose was repeated weekly if the mother was still considered to be at risk for preterm delivery and the duration of gestation was less than 32 weeks. We assessed survival free of major neurosensory disability and body size of the children at 2 years of corrected age.
RESULTS: Of the 1085 children who were alive at 2 years of age, 1047 (96.5\%) were seen for assessment (521 exposed to repeat-corticosteroid treatment and 526 exposed to placebo). The rate of survival free of major disability was similar in the repeat-corticosteroid and placebo groups (84.4\% and 81.0\%, respectively; adjusted relative risk, 1.04, 95\% confidence interval, 0.98 to 1.10; adjusted P=0.20). There were no significant differences between the groups in body size, blood pressure, use of health services, respiratory morbidity, or child behavior scores, although children exposed to repeat doses of corticosteroids were more likely than those exposed to placebo to warrant assessment for attention problems (P=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of repeat doses of antenatal corticosteroids reduces neonatal morbidity without changing either survival free of major neurosensory disability or body size at 2 years of age. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN48656428 [controlled-trials.com].).},

This study was undertaken to determine the effects of repeated courses of antenatal corticosteroids on childhood behavior and disabilities, including cognitive delay and cerebral palsy.
Study design
Nonrandomized regional cohort of 541 very preterm infants born in Western Australia from singleton pregnancies and alive at 3 years were included in the study.
Main outcome measures
Physical, cognitive, and psychological assessments up to 6 years.
Results
Increasing numbers of antenatal corticosteroid courses were associated with a reduction in the rate of cerebral palsy. Three or more courses were also associated with increased rates of aggressive/destructive, distractible, and hyperkinetic behavior and these effects were present at both ages 3 and 6 years. Measures of internalizing behavior and intelligence quotient were unaffected by antenatal corticosteroid use.
Conclusion
Repeated antenatal courses of corticosteroids may protect against cerebral palsy but are associated with hyperactivity later in childhood.},

The present study was carried out to investigate whether BPA can bind to human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and elucidate its mode of interaction. BPA has been successfully docked in silico into the ligand binding site of GR using the program Discovery Studio 2.0. The structure has been compared with other agonist and antagonist bound structures of GR. It is found that the mode of interactions and binding energy of BPA were similar to that of DEXA and cortisol, two known agonists of GR. This reveals that BPA can bind to GR as an agonist. Hence, BPA may produce biological effects similar to that produced by glucocorticoids.},

Given the interaction of sex and stress hormones, we examined the effect of a low perinatal BPA exposure on the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis at rest and upon application of acute stress. Throughout pregnancy and lactation rats received daily 40 μg BPA/kg body weight orally via cornflakes. We studied the effect of this low but chronic exposure to BPA in the male and female offspring at puberty. BPA exposure led to abnormal adrenal histology including reduced zona reticularis especially in male offspring, hyperplasia of zona fasciculata in both sexes, and increased adrenal weight in female offspring. BPA-treated females had increased basal corticosterone and reduced hypothalamic glucocorticoid receptors (GR) levels. Stressed BPA-exposed females exhibited anxiety-like behavioral coping, a less rigorous corticosterone response, and did not downregulate GR in the hypothalamus, compared with control females. BPA-exposed males exhibited a heightened corticosterone stress response compared with females; they also displayed increased pro-opiomelanocortin mRNA levels and retained the prestress levels of pituitary corticotropin-releasing hormone-receptor 1, compared with control males. We found that perinatal chronic exposure to a low dose of BPA perturbs the basal and stress-induced activity of the HPA axis in a sexually dimorphic manner at adolescence. Exposure to BPA might contribute to increased susceptibility to stress-related disorders in later life.},

	abstract = {The reaction of hemoglobin (Hb) with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) results in free radicals generated at the heme iron, followed by radical transfer to the porphyrin/globin. In the present work, we employed isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and a LC-MALDI-MS/MS-based proteomic approach to identify the extent of oxidative changes within tetrameric Hb and dimeric Hb-haptoglobin (Hb-Hp) complexes. Extensive oxidative modifications were found to be restricted to peptides containing alphaTyr42, betaTyr145, and betaCys93. The protein region composed of these peptides appears to define an area of oxidative activity within the Hb tetramer that extends across the critical alpha1beta2/alpha2beta1 interface. Extensive oxidative modifications occurring at betaCys93 indicate that this surface amino acid is an important end point for free radical induced protein oxidation within Hb. Conversely when Hp 1-1 or 2-2 was complexed with dissociable Hb, oxidative changes in Hp complexed dimeric Hb were prevented. This protection was not observed in a stabilized tetrameric Hb, which displays a weak binding affinity for Hp. Therefore, dimerization of Hb and Hp binding may interfere with free radical translocation and play an important role in the overall antioxidant mechanism of Hp. Interestingly, the prevention of peroxide induced Hb amino acid oxidation in purified Hb-Hp1-1 and Hb-Hp2-2 was found to be equal, indicating a phenotype independent specificity in the process of oxidative protection. Taken together, these data suggest differences in oxidative modifications resulting from peroxide induced heme emanated free radical distribution in tetrameric compared to Hp1-1/Hp2-2 stabilized dimeric Hb.},

In this study, subjects viewed an audiovisual movie continuously for 25 min; another group viewed the movie in 2 parts separated by a 1-day delay. Understanding Part 2 depended on retrieving information from Part 1, and thus hippocampus was required in the day-delay condition. But is hippocampus equally recruited to access the same information from minutes earlier? We show that accessing memories from a few minutes prior elicited less interaction between hippocampus and default mode network (DMN) cortical regions than accessing day-old memories of identical events, suggesting that recent information was available with less reliance on hippocampal retrieval. Moreover, the 2 groups evinced reliable but distinct DMN activity timecourses, reflecting differences in information carried in these regions when Part 1 was recent versus distant. The timecourses converged after 4 min, suggesting a time frame over which the continuous-viewing group may have relied less on hippocampal retrieval. We propose that cortical default mode regions can intrinsically retain real-life episodic information for several minutes.},

We found increased DNA methylation of Fkbp5 and reduced protein levels in the hippocampus of exposed male rats. Similar effects were obtained in a male hippocampal cell line when exposed to BPA during differentiation. The estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780 or ERβ knock-down affected Fkbp5 expression and methylation similarly to BPA. Further, BPA's effect on Fkbp5 was abolished upon knock-down of ERβ, suggesting a role for this receptor in mediating BPA's effects on Fkbp5.

This mini-review aims to summarize and discuss the available findings from animal studies regarding BPA effects on the stress system and the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis in particular. It appears that perinatal exposure of rodents to low doses of BPA, around the human tolerable daily intake, can modify the levels, expression and epigenetic patterning of key stress mediators at later-life stages in a sex-specific way. These observations provide evidence that developmental exposure to one of the most highly produced chemicals today may contribute to the regulation of the stress axis. Given the importance of the HPA axis in coordination of the organisms' global homeostasis and its implications in stress-related disorders, further studies are needed to delineate the underling mechanisms of these BPA actions.},

Fifteen widely used industrial chemicals that disrupt endocrine activity were selected for evaluation of potential (anti)glucocorticoid and (anti)androgenic activities. The human breast carcinoma MDA-kb2 cell line was utilized for reporter gene assays, since it expresses both the androgen and the glucocorticoid-responsive reporter. Two new antiandrogens, 4,4'-sulfonylbis(2-methylphenol) (dBPS) and 4,4'-thiodiphenol (THIO), and two new antiglucocorticoids, bisphenol Z and its analog bis[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl] sulfone (BHEPS) were identified. Moreover, four new glucocorticoid agonists (methyl paraben, ethyl paraben, propyl paraben and bisphenol F) were found. To elucidate the structure-activity relationship of bisphenols, we performed molecular docking experiments with androgen and glucocorticoid receptor. These docking experiments had shown that bulky structures such as BHEPS and bisphenol Z act as antiglucocorticoid, because they are positioned toward helix H12 in the antagonist conformation and could therefore be responsible for H12 conformational change and the switch between agonistic and antagonistic conformation of receptor. On the other hand smaller structures cannot interact with H12. The results of in vitro screening of fifteen industrial chemicals as modulators of the glucocorticoid and androgen receptor activities demand additional in vivo testing of these chemicals for formulating any relevant hazard identification to human health.},

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is often a consequence of insufficiency, and is associated with a high incidence of perinatal morbidity and mortality, as well as increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in later life. Several different experimental methods have been used to induce placental insufficiency and IUGR in animal models and a range of factors that regulate placental growth and substrate transport capacity have been demonstrated.

Nevertheless, only a few human studies have directly assessed the effects of prenatal cortisol exposure on infant cortisol reactivity, and none have investigated sex differences or potential interactions between prenatal cortisol and psychological distress. Here we report on a prospective longitudinal investigation (N = 236) of in utero exposure to maternal cortisol and distress in a relatively high socioeconomic status and low-risk population to determine whether these exposures interact in their effects on infant (M age = 3.0 months, range = 2.3-5.0 months, 51.9\% male) cortisol reactivity and whether there are sex differences in these effects. Results revealed both sexually dimorphic and interactive effects of prenatal cortisol and distress, even after controlling for postnatal distress. In general, blunted reactivity in females was associated with exposure to high maternal distress and flattened patterns of diurnal maternal cortisol, whereas blunted reactivity in males was associated with exposure to steeper morning increases and daytime decreases in maternal cortisol. The findings suggest that sex differences in the effects of prenatal cortisol and distress on infant cortisol reactivity are a plausible mechanism by which maternal experiences during pregnancy contribute to sex differences in the development of psychopathology.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether BPA exposure during pregnancy is associated with dysregulation of the HPA-axis, we examined the association between urinary BPA concentrations and diurnal salivary cortisol in pregnant women. Secondary analyses investigated whether the association between BPA and cortisol was dependent on fetal sex.
METHODS: Diurnal salivary cortisol and urinary BPA were collected during pregnancy from 174 women in a longitudinal cohort study, the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study. Associations between BPA and daytime cortisol and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) were estimated using mixed models after adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: Higher concentrations of total BPA uncorrected for urinary creatinine were associated with dysregulation of the daytime cortisol pattern, including reduced cortisol at waking, β=-.055, 95\% CI (-.100, -.010) and a flatter daytime pattern, β=.014, 95\% CI (.006, .022) and β=-.0007 95\% CI (-.001, -.0002) for the linear and quadratic slopes, respectively. Effect sizes in creatinine corrected BPA models were slightly smaller. None of the interactions between fetal sex and BPA were significant (all 95\% CI's include zero).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the first human evidence suggesting that BPA exposure is associated with dysregulation of HPA-axis function during pregnancy.},

Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is one of the most consistent biological findings in anxiety- and depression-related disorders. The HPA axis is reported to be susceptible to developmental reprogramming. The present study focused on HPA reactivity in postnatal day (PND) 80 male rats exposed perinatally to environmental-dose BPA. When female breeders were orally administered 2 μg/(kg.day) BPA from gestation day 10 to lactation day 7, their offspring (PND 80 BPA-exposed rats) showed obvious anxiety/depression-like behaviors. Notably, significant increase in serum corticosterone and adrenocorticotropin, and corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA were detected in BPA-exposed rats before or after the mild stressor. Additionally, the level of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA in the hippocampus, but not the hypothalamus, was decreased in BPA-exposed rats. The levels of hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA, neuronal nitric oxide synthase and phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein were increased in BPA-exposed rats. In addition, the testosterone level was in BPA-exposed rats. The results indicate that reprogramming-induced hyperactivity of the HPA axis is an important link between perinatal BPA exposure and persistent potentiation in anxiety and depression.},

	abstract = {Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a well-known environmental endocrine disruptor. Developmental exposure to BPA affected a variety of behaviors in multiple model organisms. Our recent study found that exposure to BPA during adulthood aggravated anxiety- and depression-like states in male mice but not in females. In this study, 11-w-old gonadectomied (GDX) male mice daily received subcutaneous injections of testosterone propionate (TP, 0.5 mg/kg), TP and BPA (0.04, 0.4, or 4 mg/kg), or vehicle for 45 days. BPA (0.4 or 4 mg/kg) did not affect the elevated plus maze task of GDX mice but shortened the time on open arms and decreased the frequency of head dips of sham and TP-GDX mice. In forced swim task, BPA prolonged the total time of immobility of both sham and TP-GDX mice but not GDX mice. In addition, BPA reduced the levels of T in the serum and the brain of sham and TP-GDX mice. Western blot analysis further showed that BPA reduced the levels of androgen receptor (AR) and GABA(A)α2 receptor of the hippocampus and the amygdala in sham and inhibited the rescue of TP in these proteins levels of GDX mice. Meanwhile, BPA decreased the level of phospho-ERK1/2 in these two brain regions of sham and TP-GDX mice. These results suggest that long-term exposure to BPA inhibited TP-improved anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in GDX male mice. The down-regulated levels of GABA(A)α2 receptor and AR and an inhibited activity of ERK1/2 pathway in the hippocampus and the amygdala may be involved in these process.},

	abstract = {In biomarker-disease association studies, the long-term average level of a biomarker is often considered the optimal measure of exposure. Long-term average levels may not be accurately measured from a single sample, however, because of systematic temporal variation. For example, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations may fluctuate because of seasonal variation in sun exposure. Association studies of 25(OH)D and cancer risk have used different strategies to minimize bias from such seasonal variation, including adjusting for date of sample collection (DOSC), often after matching on DOSC, and/or using season-specific cutpoints to assign subjects to exposure categories. To evaluate and understand the impact of such strategies on potential bias, the authors simulated a population in which 25(OH)D levels varied between individuals and by season, and disease risk was determined by long-term average 25(OH)D. Ignoring temporal variation resulted in bias toward the null. When cutpoints that did not account for DOSC were used, adjustment for DOSC sometimes resulted in bias away from the null. Using season- or month-specific cutpoints reduced bias toward the null and did not cause bias away from the null. To avoid potential bias away from the null, using season- or month-specific cutpoints may be preferable to adjusting for DOSC.},

However, variations in urinary creatinine (a measure of dilution) or serum lipid levels, if not adequately corrected for, can directly impact biomarker concentrations and bias exposure-disease association measures.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent methodological literature has considered the complex relationships between creatinine or serum lipid levels, exposure biomarkers, outcomes, and other potentially relevant factors using directed acyclic graphs and simulation studies. The optimal measures of urinary dilution and serum lipids have also been investigated. Existing evidence supports the use of covariate-adjusted standardization plus creatinine adjustment for urinary biomarkers and standardization plus serum lipid adjustment for lipophilic, serum-based biomarkers. It is unclear which urinary dilution measure is best, but all serum lipid measures performed similarly. Future research should assess methods for pooled biomarkers and for studying diseases and exposures that affect creatinine or serum lipids directly.},

Exposure quantification may be compromised when measurement is subject to a lower threshold. Statistical modeling of such data requires a decision regarding the handling of such readings. Various authors have considered this problem. In the context of linear regression analysis, Richardson and Ciampi proposed replacement of data below a threshold by a constant equal to the expectation for such data to yield unbiased estimates. Use of such an imputation has some limitations; distributional assumptions are required, and bias reduction in estimation of regression parameters is asymptotic, thereby presenting concerns to small studies. In this paper the authors propose distribution-free methods for managing values below detection limits and evaluate the biases that may result when exposure measurement is constrained by a lower threshold. The authors utilize an analytical approach as well as a simulation study to assess the effects of the proposed replacement method on estimates. These results may inform decisions regarding analytical plans for future studies as well as provide possible explanation for some amount of discordance seen in extant literature.},

It is well recognized that under certain conditions, nondifferential measurement error in the exposure variable produces bias towards the null. Measurement error in confounders will lead to residual confounding, but this is not a straightforward issue, and it is not clear in which direction the bias will point. Unmeasured confounders further complicate matters. There has been discussion about the amount of bias in exposure effect estimates that can plausibly occur due to residual or unmeasured confounding. In this paper, the authors use simulation studies and logistic regression analyses to investigate the size of the apparent exposure-outcome association that can occur when in truth the exposure has no causal effect on the outcome. The authors consider two cases with a normally distributed exposure and either two or four normally distributed confounders. When the confounders are uncorrelated, bias in the exposure effect estimate increases as the amount of residual and unmeasured confounding increases. Patterns are more complex for correlated confounders. With plausible assumptions, effect sizes of the magnitude frequently reported in observational epidemiologic studies can be generated by residual and/or unmeasured confounding alone.},

Recent theoretical and methodological developments have helped clarify a number of principles of confounder selection. When complete knowledge of a causal diagram relating all covariates to each other is available, graphical rules can be used to make decisions about covariate control. Unfortunately, such complete knowledge is often unavailable. This paper puts forward a practical approach to confounder selection decisions when the somewhat less stringent assumption is made that knowledge is available for each covariate whether it is a cause of the exposure, and whether it is a cause of the outcome. Based on recent theoretically justified developments in the causal inference literature, the following proposal is made for covariate control decisions: control for each covariate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome. Various principles of confounder selection are then further related to statistical covariate selection methods.},

Most Q-Q plots could benefit from the addition of meaningful global testing bands, but the use of such bands unfortunately remains rare because of the drawbacks of current approaches and packages. These drawbacks include incorrect global Type I error rate, lack of power to detect deviations in the tails of the distribution, relatively slow computation for large data sets, and limited applicability. To solve these problems, we apply the equal local levels global testing method, which we have implemented in the R Package qqconf, a versatile tool to create Q-Q plots and probability-probability (P-P) plots in a wide variety of settings, with simultaneous testing bands rapidly created using recently-developed algorithms. qqconf can easily be used to add global testing bands to Q-Q plots made by other packages. In addition to being quick to compute, these bands have a variety of desirable properties, including accurate global levels, equal sensitivity to deviations in all parts of the null distribution (including the tails), and applicability to a range of null distributions. We illustrate the use of qqconf in several applications: assessing normality of residuals from regression, assessing accuracy of p values, and use of Q-Q plots in genome-wide association studies.},

One sufficient condition for identifying the causal effect is that the treatment-outcome relationship is unconfounded conditional on the observed covariates. It is often believed that the more covariates we condition on, the more plausible this unconfoundedness assumption is. This belief has had a huge impact on practical causal inference, suggesting that we should adjust for all pretreatment covariates. However, when there is unmeasured confounding between the treatment and outcome, estimators adjusting for some pretreatment covariate might have greater bias than estimators that do not adjust for this covariate. This kind of covariate is called a bias amplifier, and includes instrumental variables that are independent of the confounder and affect the outcome only through the treatment. Previously, theoretical results for this phenomenon have been established only for linear models. We fill this gap in the literature by providing a general theory, showing that this phenomenon happens under a wide class of models satisfying certain monotonicity assumptions.},

Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from data. However, when study groups are not evenly distributed across batches, actual group differences may induce apparent batch differences, in which case batch adjustments may bias, usually deflate, group differences. Some tools therefore have the option of preserving the difference between study groups, e.g. using a two-way ANOVA model to simultaneously estimate both group and batch effects. Unfortunately, this approach may systematically induce incorrect group differences in downstream analyses when groups are distributed between the batches in an unbalanced manner.

We examine PRP’s effects on parent-, teacher-, and self-reports of adolescents’ externalizing and broader internalizing (depression/anxiety, somatic complaints, and social withdrawal) symptoms over three years of follow-up. Relative to no intervention control, PRP reduced parent-reports of adolescents’ internalizing symptoms beginning at the first assessment after the intervention and persisting for most of the follow-up assessments. PRP also reduced parent-reported conduct problems relative to no-intervention. There was no evidence that the PRP program produced an effect on teacher- or self-report of adolescents’ symptoms. Overall, PRP did not reduce symptoms relative to the alternate intervention, although there is a suggestion of a delayed effect for conduct problems. These findings are discussed with attention to developmental trajectories and the importance of interventions that address common risk factors for diverse forms of negative outcomes.},

Unfortunately, reducing the type I error for null associations increases the type II error for those associations that are not null. The theoretical basis for advocating a routine adjustment for multiple comparisons is the "universal null hypothesis" that "chance" serves as the first-order explanation for observed phenomena. This hypothesis undermines the basic premises of empirical research, which holds that nature follows regular laws that may be studied through observations. A policy of not making adjustments for multiple comparisons is preferable because it will lead to fewer errors of interpretation when the data under evaluation are not random numbers but actual observations on nature. Furthermore, scientists should not be so reluctant to explore leads that may turn out to be wrong that they penalize themselves by missing possibly important findings.},

	abstract = {Background
Environmental phenols and parabens are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with the potential to affect child neurodevelopment including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Our aim was to assess whether exposure to environmental phenols and parabens during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of clinical ASD or other nontypical development (non-TD).
Methods
This study included mother-child pairs (N = 207) from the Markers of Autism Risks in Babies – Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) Cohort Study with urinary phenol and paraben metabolites analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) from repeated pregnancy urine samples. Because family recurrence risks in siblings are about 20\%, MARBLES enrolls pregnant women who already had a child with ASD. Children were clinically assessed at 3 years of age and classified into 3 outcome categories: ASD, non-TD, or typically developing (TD). Single analyte analyses were conducted with trinomial logistic regression and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression was used to test for mixture effects.
Results
Regression models were adjusted for pre-pregnancy body mass index, prenatal vitamin use (yes/no), homeowner status (yes/no), birth year, and child's sex. In single chemical analyses phenol exposures were not significantly associated with child's diagnosis. Mixture analyses using trinomial WQS regression showed a significantly increased risk of non-TD compared to TD (OR = 1.58, 95\% CI: 1.04, 2.04) with overall greater prenatal phenol and paraben metabolites mixture. Results for ASD also showed an increased risk, but it was not significant.
Discussion
This is the first study to provide evidence that pregnancy environmental phenol exposures may increase the risk for non-TD in a high-risk population.},

	abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that psychological distress during pregnancy is linked to offspring risk for externalizing outcomes (e.g., reactive/aggressive behaviors, hyperactivity, and impulsivity). Effect sizes across studies have varied widely, however, due to differences in study design and methodology, including control for the confounding continuation of distress in the postnatal period. Clarifying these inconsistencies is necessary to guide the precision of prevention efforts and inform public health policies. A meta-analysis was conducted with 55 longitudinal studies to investigate the association between prenatal psychological distress (anxiety, depression, and perceived stress) and offspring externalizing behaviors. Results revealed a significant but small effect (r = .160) of prenatal distress on externalizing behaviors. The magnitude of the prenatal effect size remained largely unchanged after adjusting for postnatal distress (r = .159), implicating a unique effect of psychological distress during the prenatal period in the etiology of externalizing behaviors. Moderation tests showed that prenatal effects did not vary based on type and timing of psychological distress during pregnancy. Greater instability of distress from prenatal to postnatal periods predicted larger effects. Prenatal effects were comparable across most externalizing outcomes, consistent with the common comorbidity of externalizing spectrum disorders, although effects appeared smaller for nonaggressive rule-breaking (vs. aggressive) behaviors. Significant associations persisted across all developmental periods, appearing slightly larger in early childhood. We discuss these results in the context of developmental and psychobiological theories of externalizing behavior, offer preliminary clinical and public health implications, and highlight directions for future research including the need for longitudinal studies with more racially and socioeconomically diverse families.

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, -0.022; 95\% CI, -0.04 to -0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, -0.017; 95\% CI, -0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to organochlorine and PFAS may be associated with lower neonatal TT4 level.},

Of emerging interest is how these chemicals may also affect the immune response, given the cross-talk between the endocrine and immune systems. As brain development is strongly dependent on hormones including thyroid, androgens, and estrogens, and can also be affected by immunomodulation, this complicated interplay may have long-lasting neurodevelopmental consequences. This review focuses on data available from human cohorts, in vivo models, and in vitro assays regarding the impact of EDCs after a gestational and/or lactational exposure, and how they may impact the immune system and/or neurodevelopment.},

Methods: We performed a systematic review with key words referring to the fields of neurodevelopment and endocrine disruptors. We reviewed 896 titles, choosing studies on the basis of titles and abstracts. We searched through the methodology sections to find perinatal exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders, following the categories indicated in the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition). References in some studies brought us to a total of 47 studies included here. Results: Convergent studies report an association between exposure to endocrine disruptors and autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, communication disorders and unspecified neurodevelopmental disorders. Conclusion: Sufficient data exist to report that exposure to some endocrine disruptors is a risk factor for the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders. Studying endocrine disruptor exposure in humans is still associated with some limits that are difficult to overcome.},

Since normal thyroid function during pregnancy is transcendental for the neurodevelopment of the offspring, knowledge of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) is of main importance. The aim of our study is to recognize and describe EDC actions in pregnant women and focus on neurodevelopmental processes that can lead to neurotransmitter imbalance and cognitive impairment, and the possible clinical outcomes in the newborn and child. We searched PubMed databases for animal studies and clinical trials evaluating chemicals recognized as thyroid disruptors -perchlorate, phthalates, bisphenol A-, as well as chemicals with potential thyroid disruption activity -parabens, pesticides and persistent organic pollutants, on thyroid hormones (THs) levels and their bioavailability during pregnancy, and the outcome in newborns, infants and children. We also exhibit evidence from worldwide cohort studies to this regard. The publications reviewed show: 1) known endocrine disruptors have an association with hormonal thyroid levels, where an effect of increase or decrease in TH concentrations has been reported depending on the chemical exposed 2) associations between TH, EDCs and neurocognitive disorders have been addressed, such as ADHD, though no conclusive impact on potential related disorders as autism has been established, 3) perchlorate has demonstrated effects on thyroid levels on iodine uptake. In conclusion, detrimental risks and long-term consequences after in-utero exposure to EDCs are being reported in several cohort studies and further research must be conducted to establish a well-known cause-effect association.},

BPA has been successfully docked in silico into the ligand binding site of GR using the program Discovery Studio 2.0.

It is found that the mode of interactions and binding energy of BPA were similar to that of DEXA and cortisol, two known agonists of GR. This reveals that BPA can bind to GR as an agonist.

BPA is detected in animal tissues, and its bio-accumulation has shown to be higher in the fetus than the mother. Exposure to doses below the daily safe limit has been reported to affect the sexual differentiation of the brain and modify the behavior of the exposed rodent offspring. The aim of the present study was to investigate in the rat the possible organizational effects of low BPA exposure on glucocorticoid-regulated responses. Female breeders were exposed to 40 microg/kg b.w. BPA daily throughout pregnancy and lactation. Plasma corticosterone levels and the two types of hippocampal corticosteroid receptors (GR and MR) were determined in mid-adolescent offspring under basal conditions and following a Y-maze task. BPA treated females had higher corticosterone levels than control females and BPA males and lower GR levels than BPA males, under basal conditions. Following the mildly stressful experience of Y-maze, corticosterone levels were increased in BPA-treated animals of both sexes, compared to the controls. GR levels were also increased in BPA-treated females compared to males. No effect of BPA was observed on MR levels, whereas the Y-maze experience significantly decreased receptors' levels in both female groups. The animals' performance in the task was also evaluated. BPA exposure significantly impaired the spatial recognition memory in both sexes, and modified the behavioural coping in a sex-dependent manner. Female BPA-treated offspring exhibited increased "anxiety-like" behaviour and dramatic loss of exploration attitude during the task, in comparison to males. This study provides for the first time evidence that corticosterone and its actions in the brain are sensitive to the programming effects of BPA at a dose below the currently acceptable daily intake.},

	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION
Are maternal and paternal preconception urinary bisphenol A (BPA) or bisphenol S (BPS) concentrations associated with offspring birth size?

SUMMARY ANSWER
Maternal—but not paternal—preconception urinary BPA concentrations were associated with lower birth size among couples seeking fertility evaluation.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY
Prenatal BPA exposure has been previously associated with reduced birth size in some but not all epidemiologic studies. However, the potential effect of BPA exposure before conception in either parent is unknown. Data on BPS is practically absent.

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION
Ongoing prospective preconception cohort of women and men seeking fertility evaluation between 2005 and 2016 in a large fertility center in an academic hospital in Boston, MA, USA.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS
We examined the association between maternal and paternal preconception, as well as maternal prenatal urinary BPA and BPS concentrations, and size at birth among 346 singletons from couples recruited in the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) Study using multivariable linear regression. Infant birth weight and head circumference were abstracted from delivery records. Mean preconception and prenatal exposures were estimated by averaging urinary ln-BPA and ln-BPS concentrations in multiple maternal and paternal urine samples collected before pregnancy, and maternal pregnancy samples collected in each trimester.

MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE
Maternal preconception urinary BPA concentrations were inversely associated with birth weight and head circumference in adjusted models: each ln-unit increase was associated with a decrease in birth weight of 119 g (95\% CI: −212, −27), and a head circumference decrease of 0.72 cm (95\% CI: −1.3, −0.1). Additional adjustment by gestational age or prenatal BPA exposure modestly attenuated results. Women with higher prenatal BPA concentrations had infants with lower mean birth weight (−75 g, 95\% CI: −153, 2) although this did not achieve statistical significance. Paternal preconception urinary BPA concentrations were not associated with either birth weight or head circumference. No consistent patterns emerged for BPS concentrations measured in either parent.

LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION
We observed a strong negative association between maternal—but not paternal—preconception BPA concentrations and offspring birth size among a subfertile population. Although these results are overall consistent with prior studies on prenatal BPA exposure, these findings may not be generalizable to women without fertility concerns.

WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS
This study suggests that the unexplored maternal preconception period may be a sensitive window for BPA effects on birth outcomes.

	abstract = {Background
Harmonized data describing simultaneous exposure to a large number of environmental contaminants in-utero and during childhood is currently very limited.
Objectives
To characterize concentrations of a large number of environmental contaminants in pregnant women from Europe and their children, based on chemical analysis of biological samples from mother-child pairs.
Methods
We relied on the Early-Life Exposome project, HELIX, a collaborative project across six established population-based birth cohort studies in Europe. In 1301 subjects, biomarkers of exposure to 45 contaminants (i.e. organochlorine compounds, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, toxic and essential elements, phthalate metabolites, environmental phenols, organophosphate pesticide metabolites and cotinine) were measured in biological samples from children (6–12 years) and their mothers during pregnancy, using highly sensitive biomonitoring methods.
Results
Most of the exposure biomarkers had high detection frequencies in mothers (35 out of 45 biomarkers with {\textgreater}90\% detected) and children (33 out of 45 biomarkers with {\textgreater}90\% detected). Concentrations were significantly different between cohorts for all compounds, and were generally higher in maternal compared to children samples. For most of the persistent compounds the correlations between maternal and child concentrations were moderate to high (Spearman Rho {\textgreater} 0.35), while for most non-persistent compounds correlations were considerably lower (Spearman Rho {\textless} 0.15). For mercury, PFOS and PFOA a considerable proportion of the samples of both mothers and their children exceeded the HBM I value established by The Human Biomonitoring Commission of the German Federal Environment Agency.
Discussion
Although not based on a representative sample, our study suggests that children across Europe are exposed to a wide range of environmental contaminants in fetal life and childhood including many with potential adverse effects. For values exceeding the HBM I value identification of specific sources of exposure and reducing exposure in an adequate way is recommended. Considerable variability in this “chemical exposome” was seen between cohorts, showing that place of residence is a strong determinant of one's personal exposome. This extensive dataset comprising {\textgreater}100,000 concentrations of environmental contaminants in mother-child pairs forms a unique possibility for conducting epidemiological studies using an exposome approach.},

	abstract = {Background Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and other chronic diseases are caused by a complex combination of many genetic and environmental factors. Few methods are available to comprehensively associate specific physical environmental factors with disease. We conducted a pilot Environmental-Wide Association Study (EWAS), in which epidemiological data are comprehensively and systematically interpreted in a manner analogous to a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). Methods and Findings We performed multiple cross-sectional analyses associating 266 unique environmental factors with clinical status for T2D defined by fasting blood sugar (FBG) concentration ≥126 mg/dL. We utilized available Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts from years 1999 to 2006. Within cohort sample numbers ranged from 503 to 3,318. Logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, and an estimate of socioeconomic status (SES). As in GWAS, multiple comparisons were controlled and significant findings were validated with other cohorts. We discovered significant associations for the pesticide-derivative heptachlor epoxide (adjusted OR in three combined cohorts of 1.7 for a 1 SD change in exposure amount; p{\textless}0.001), and the vitamin γ-tocopherol (adjusted OR 1.5; p{\textless}0.001). Higher concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) such as PCB170 (adjusted OR 2.2; p{\textless}0.001) were also found. Protective factors associated with T2D included β-carotenes (adjusted OR 0.6; p{\textless}0.001). Conclusions and Significance Despite difficulty in ascertaining causality, the potential for novel factors of large effect associated with T2D justify the use of EWAS to create hypotheses regarding the broad contribution of the environment to disease. Even in this study based on prior collected epidemiological measures, environmental factors can be found with effect sizes comparable to the best loci yet found by GWAS.},

	abstract = {There has been a growing interest in the literature on multiple environmental risk factors for diseases and an increasing emphasis on assessing multiple environmental exposures simultaneously in epidemiologic studies of cancer. One method used to analyze exposure to multiple chemical exposures is weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression. While WQS regression has been demonstrated to have good sensitivity and specificity when identifying important exposures, it has limitations including a two-step model fitting process that decreases power and model stability and a requirement that all exposures in the weighted index have associations in the same direction with the outcome, which is not realistic when chemicals in different classes have different directions and magnitude of association with a health outcome. Grouped WQS (GWQS) was proposed to allow for multiple groups of chemicals in the model where different magnitude and direction of associations are possible for each group. However, GWQS shares the limitation of WQS of a two-step estimation process and splitting of data into training and validation sets. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian group index model to avoid the estimation limitation of GWQS while having multiple exposure indices in the model. To evaluate the performance of the Bayesian group index model, we conducted a simulation study with several different exposure scenarios. We also applied the Bayesian group index method to analyze childhood leukemia risk in the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS). The results showed that the Bayesian group index model had slightly better power for exposure effects and specificity and sensitivity in identifying important chemical exposure components compared with the existing frequentist method, particularly for small sample sizes. In the application to the CCLS, we found a significant negative association for insecticides, with the most important chemical being carbaryl. In addition, for children who were born and raised in the home where dust samples were taken, there was a significant positive association for herbicides with dacthal being the most important exposure. In conclusion, our approach of the Bayesian group index model appears able to make a substantial contribution to the field of environmental epidemiology.},

We illustrate the use of weakly informative priors with an example of the association of lifetime alcohol consumption and head and neck cancer. When data are sparse and the observed information is weak, a weakly informative prior will shrink parameter estimates toward the prior mean. Additionally, the example shows that when data are not sparse and the observed information is not weak, a weakly informative prior is not influential.

As with tutorials outlining the calculus behind maximum likelihood in previous decades, a simple description of the machinery of MCMC is needed. We provide an introduction to conducting analyses with MCMC, and show that, given the same data and under certain model specifications, the results of an MCMC simulation match those of methods based on standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). In addition, we highlight examples of instances in which MCMC approaches to data analysis provide a clear advantage over MLE. We hope that this brief tutorial will encourage epidemiologists to consider MCMC approaches as part of their analytic tool-kit.},

A Bayesian analysis of such trials might provide a framework to combine prior evidence with current evidence, and it is an accepted approach by regulatory agencies. However, especially for small trials, the Bayesian inference may be severely conditioned by the prior choices. The Renal Scarring Urinary Infection (RESCUE) trial, a pediatric trial that was a candidate for early termination due to underrecruitment, served as a motivating example to investigate the effects of the prior choices on small trial inference. The trial outcomes were simulated by assuming 50 scenarios combining different sample sizes and true absolute risk reduction (ARR). The simulated data were analyzed via the Bayesian approach using 0\%, 50\%, and 100\% discounting factors on the beta power prior. An informative inference (0\% discounting) on small samples could generate data-insensitive results. Instead, the 50\% discounting factor ensured that the probability of confirming the trial outcome was higher than 80\%, but only for an ARR higher than 0.17. A suitable option to maintain data relevant to the trial inference is to define a discounting factor based on the prior parameters. Nevertheless, a sensitivity analysis of the prior choices is highly recommended.},

	abstract = {Our previous articles demonstrated how to analyze psychophysical data from a group of participants using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and two-level methods. The aim of this article is to revisit hierarchical models in a Bayesian framework. Bayesian models have been previously discussed for the analysis of psychometric functions although this approach is still seldom applied. The main advantage of using Bayesian models is that if the prior is informative, the uncertainty of the parameters is reduced through the combination of prior knowledge and the experimental data. Here, we evaluate uncertainties between and within participants through posterior distributions. To demonstrate the Bayesian approach, we re-analyzed data from two of our previous studies on the tactile discrimination of speed. We considered different methods to include a priori knowledge in the prior distribution, not only from the literature but also from previous experiments. A special type of Bayesian model, the power prior distribution, allowed us to modulate the weight of the prior, constructed from a first set of data, and use it to fit a second one. Bayesian models estimated the probability distributions of the parameters of interest that convey information about the effects of the experimental variables, their uncertainty, and the reliability of individual participants. We implemented these models using the software Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) that we interfaced with R with the package rjags. The Bayesian hierarchical model will provide a promising and powerful method for the analysis of psychometric functions in psychophysical experiments.},

A two-stage analytical approach is used in meta-analysis for its computational convenience and flexibility. The first stage estimates the association for each study whereas the second stage combines the study-specific estimates correcting for the study-specific error. The second stage often incorporates study-specific covariates (metapredictors) and is called metaregression. One application where the two-stage meta-analysis is useful is an epidemiological study for the health effects of environmental exposure, which often analyses time series data of exposure and health outcome collected from multiple locations. The first stage models location-specific association, which is often represented by multiple parameters as the association is non-linear or delayed, and the second stage conducts a multivariate metaregression with location-specific characteristics as metapredictors. The currently used multivariate metaregression is a form of normal linear regression, which may be limited as it assumes linearity in metapredictors, residual normality and homoscedasticity. In the paper, we propose a flexible multivariate metaregression in a non-parametric Bayesian modelling framework incorporating a residual spatial dependence. The proposed metaregression was evaluated through a simulation study and applied to investigate a temperature–mortality association in the 135 US cities.},

Here, we introduce a method that leverages polygenic functional enrichment to incorporate coding, conserved, regulatory, and LD-related genomic annotations into association analyses. We show via simulations with real genotypes that the method, functionally informed novel discovery of risk loci (FINDOR), correctly controls the false-positive rate at null loci and attains a 9\%-38\% increase in the number of independent associations detected at causal loci, depending on trait polygenicity and sample size. We applied FINDOR to 27 independent complex traits and diseases from the interim UK Biobank release (average N = 130K). Averaged across traits, we attained a 13\% increase in genome-wide significant loci detected (including a 20\% increase for disease traits) compared to unweighted raw p values that do not use functional data. We replicated the additional loci in independent UK Biobank and non-UK Biobank data, yielding a highly statistically significant replication slope (0.66-0.69) in each case. Finally, we applied FINDOR to the full UK Biobank release (average N = 416K), attaining smaller relative improvements (consistent with simulations) but larger absolute improvements, detecting an additional 583 GWAS loci.

	abstract = {The multiplicity problem has become increasingly important in genetic studies as the capacity for high-throughput genotyping has increased. The control of False Discovery Rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg. [1995] J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B 57:289–300) has been adopted to address the problems of false positive control and low power inherent in high-volume genome-wide linkage and association studies. In many genetic studies, there is often a natural stratification of the m hypotheses to be tested. Given the FDR framework and the presence of such stratification, we investigate the performance of a stratified false discovery control approach (i.e. control or estimate FDR separately for each stratum) and compare it to the aggregated method (i.e. consider all hypotheses in a single stratum). Under the fixed rejection region framework (i.e. reject all hypotheses with unadjusted p-values less than a pre-specified level and then estimate FDR), we demonstrate that the aggregated FDR is a weighted average of the stratum-specific FDRs. Under the fixed FDR framework (i.e. reject as many hypotheses as possible and meanwhile control FDR at a pre-specified level), we specify a condition necessary for the expected total number of true positives under the stratified FDR method to be equal to or greater than that obtained from the aggregated FDR method. Application to a recent Genome-Wide Association (GWA) study by Maraganore et al. ([2005] Am. J. Hum. Genet. 77:685–693) illustrates the potential advantages of control or estimation of FDR by stratum. Our analyses also show that controlling FDR at a low rate, e.g. 5\% or 10\%, may not be feasible for some GWA studies. Genet. Epidemiol. 2006. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In some studies, these neurotoxicants impact males and females differently. We aimed to examine the sex-specific effects of exposure to developmental neurotoxicants on intelligence (IQ) in a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHOD: We screened abstracts published in PsychINFO and PubMed before December 31st, 2021, for empirical studies of six neurotoxicants (lead, mercury, PCBs, PBDEs, OPPs, and phthalates) that (1) used an individualized biomarker; (2) measured exposure during the prenatal period or before age six; and (3) provided effect estimates on general, nonverbal, and/or verbal IQ by sex. We assessed each study for risk of bias and evaluated the certainty of the evidence using Navigation Guide. We performed separate random effect meta-analyses by sex and timing of exposure with subgroup analyses by neurotoxicant.
RESULTS: Fifty-one studies were included in the systematic review and 20 in the meta-analysis. Prenatal exposure to developmental neurotoxicants was associated with decreased general and nonverbal IQ in males, especially for lead. No significant effects were found for verbal IQ, or postnatal lead exposure and general IQ. Due to the limited number of studies, we were unable to analyze postnatal effects of any of the other neurotoxicants.
CONCLUSION: During fetal development, males may be more vulnerable than females to general and nonverbal intellectual deficits from neurotoxic exposures, especially from lead. More research is needed to examine the nuanced sex-specific effects found for postnatal exposure to toxic chemicals.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jclinepi.2018.12.005},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite plausible laboratory evidence about harms of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses of epidemiological studies do not consistently find such harms. The purpose of this article was to discuss why solid human evidence on EDCs was unlikely to be obtainable even though they are truely harmful to humans.
RESULTS: Indeed, there are insurmountable methodological limitations in human studies. They include unpredictable net effects of diverse EDC mixtures, low reliability of exposure assessment, nonmonotonic dose-response relationships, nonexistence of an unexposed group, and complicated interactions with diet and obesity. The exposome is never free from these methodological issues. Therefore, the most persuasive evidence about human harms of EDCs may be increasing EDC-linked diseases at population levels, but traditional epidemiological studies of EDCs, especially short-lived and widely used EDCs, fail to provide consistent results. Nevertheless, human studies of EDCs with long half-lives, for example, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), are still worthwhile because there are fewer methodological issues. Also, they can play a role as surrogate markers of lipophilic chemical mixtures. Notably, although POPs are well-known EDCs, human findings on POPs cannot be attributed to common hormone-disrupting properties because the net effect of diverse EDC mixtures cannot be reliably predicted even with POPs. Homeostasis disruption through mitochondrial dysfunction may be more relevant to such effects.
CONCLUSION: Logical inference should play a primary role in judging harms of EDCs in humans.},

	abstract = {Objective:
Mediation models are used in prevention and intervention research to assess the mechanisms by which interventions influence outcomes. However, researchers may not investigate mediators in the absence of intervention effects on the primary outcome variable. There is emerging evidence that in some situations, tests of mediated effects can be statistically significant when the total intervention effect is not statistically significant. In addition, there are important conceptual and practical reasons for investigating mediation when the intervention effect is nonsignificant.

Method:
This article discusses the conditions under which mediation may be present when an intervention effect does not have a statistically significant effect and why mediation should always be considered important.

Results:
Mediation may be present in the following conditions: when the total and mediated effects are equal in value, when the mediated and direct effects have opposing signs, when mediated effects are equal across single and multiple-mediator models, and when specific mediated effects have opposing signs. Mediation should be conducted in every study because it provides the opportunity to test known and replicable mediators, to use mediators as an intervention manipulation check, and to address action and conceptual theory in intervention models.

Conclusions:
Mediators are central to intervention programs, and mediators should be investigated for the valuable information they provide about the success or failure of interventions.},

	abstract = {Background
Phthalates are a group of heavily produced endocrine disruptors that are widely used in personal care products, food packaging, building materials, and medical device. Few epidemiological studies have examined the effect of repeated prenatal exposure to multiple phthalates on preschooler cognitive development.
Objectives
This study aimed to examine the association between prenatal phthalate exposure measured at multiple time points and the intelligent quotient (IQ) scores of preschoolers, and to further identify the critical windows and specific intelligence domains in which phthalate exposure would affect preschooler cognitive development.
Methods
The current study was based on the Ma’anshan Birth Cohort (MABC) study. Seven phthalate metabolites were measured in 2128 maternal urine samples collected during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy. The IQ score of preschool-aged children were assessed with the Chinese version of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth edition (WPPSI-Ⅳ CN). Linear mixed models (LMMs) were used to assess the longitudinal effects of repeated prenatal phthalate exposure on children’s IQ score. Multiple linear regression models were fitted to determine whether critical window phthalate exposure would affect cognitive development of children.
Results
Overall, the repeated measures analysis indicated that the verbal comprehension index (VCI), visual space index (VSI) and full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) decreased by 0.30 (95\% CI: −0.60, 0; p = 0.05), 0.32 (95\% CI: −0.62, −0.01; p = 0.04), and 0.31 (95\% CI:-0.57, −0.04; p = 0.02) points, respectively, with each ln-transformed increase in the metabolite concentration of MBP. The fluid reasoning index (FRI) and processing speed index (PSI) increased by 0.30 (95\% CI: 0.07, 0.54; p = 0.01) and 0.28 (95\% CI: 0.06, 0.51; p = 0.01) points, respectively, with each ln-concentration increase in MEP. Trimester-specific regression models stratified by the sample collection time during pregnancy generated consistent results. In the first trimester, each ln-transformed MBP increase was associated with reductions in VCI, VSI and FSIQ of 0.56 (95\% CI:-1.09, −0.02; p = 0.04), 0.60 (95\% CI:-1.15, −0.05; p = 0.03) and 0.49 (95\% CI:-0.97, −0.01; p = 0.04) points, respectively. In the third trimester, we observed that only MBzP exposure was associated with an increase in VCI (β: 0.48, 95\% CI: 0.03, 0.92; p = 0.04). The gender-stratified analyses revealed that boys drove these associations.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that prenatal phthalate exposure impairs the cognitive development of preschoolers. The first trimester of pregnancy might be the most vulnerable period in terms of neurotoxicitydue to phthalate exposure. These findings warrant further confirmation.},

Prior environmental epidemiology studies link numerous suspected EDCs, including phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the overall impact of prenatal exposure to an EDC mixture on neurodevelopment in school-aged children, and identify chemicals of concern while accounting for co-exposures.
METHODS: Among 718 mother-child pairs from the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy study (SELMA) study, we used Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression to assess the association between 26 EDCs measured in 1st trimester urine or blood, with Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (IV) Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores at age 7 years. Models were adjusted for child sex, gestational age, mother's education, mother's IQ (RAVEN), weight, and smoking status. To evaluate generalizability, we conducted repeated holdout validation, a machine learning technique.
RESULTS: Using repeated holdout validation, IQ scores were 1.9-points (CI = -3.6, -0.2) lower among boys for an inter-quartile-range (IQR) change in the WQS index. BPF made the largest contribution to the index with a weight of 14\%. Other chemicals of concern and their weights included PBA (9\%), TCP (9\%), MEP (6\%), MBzP (4\%), PFOA (6\%), PFOS (5\%), PFHxS (4\%), Triclosan (5\%), and BPA (4\%). While we did observe an inverse association between EDCs and IQ among all children when training and testing the WQS index estimate on the full dataset, these results were not robust to repeated holdout validation.
CONCLUSION: Among boys, early prenatal exposure to EDCs was associated with lower intellectual functioning at age 7. We identified bisphenol F as the primary chemical of concern, suggesting that the BPA replacement compound may not be any safer for children. Future studies are needed to confirm the potential neurotoxicity of replacement analogues.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early-life phthalate exposures may adversely affect children's neurodevelopment by disrupting thyroid function, reducing gonadal hormone levels, or altering fatty acid concentrations in the brain. This study aimed to identify periods of heightened susceptibility during gestation, infancy, and childhood to the impact of phthalates on children's cognitive abilities.
METHODS: We used data from 253 mother-child pairs in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study (Cincinnati, Ohio), a longitudinal pregnancy and birth cohort. We quantified urinary concentrations of 11 phthalate metabolites in samples collected twice during gestation and 6 times during study visits when children were aged 1-8 years using a modified method of on-line solid phase extraction coupled with isotope dilution-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We assessed children's intelligence (IQ) at ages 5 and 8 years using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV, respectively. We estimated covariate-adjusted associations between a 1-standard deviation increase in log10-transformed urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations at each visit and children's IQ, adjusting for demographic, perinatal, and child factors; we tested for differences in these associations across visits using multiple informant models.
RESULTS: Associations between some phthalate metabolites and IQ varied by visit (phthalate x visit interaction p-values{\textless}0.20). The sum of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (ΣDEHP), mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate, and monoethyl phthalate at age 3 years, and monobenzyl phthalate at 16 weeks gestation and child ages 3, 5, and 8 years were inversely associated with children's full-scale IQ. For example, each 1-standard deviation increase in ΣDEHP at age 3 was associated with a 1.9-point decrease in full-scale IQ (95\% confidence interval: -3.7, -0.2). Mono-n-butyl phthalate and mono-isobutyl phthalate at age 4 years were positively associated with children's full-scale IQ.
CONCLUSION: Urinary concentrations of several phthalate metabolites at age 3 years, compared to other time periods, were more strongly associated with decreased cognitive abilities in these children.},

	abstract = {Background
Phthalates are endocrine disrupters used in a variety of consumer products. Human studies suggest an association between phthalate exposure and cognitive development but adverse effects of the recently introduced phthalate substitutes have only been sparsely studied.
Objectives
To investigate associations between prenatal and concurrent exposure to phthalates and IQ in 7-year-old children from the Odense Child Cohort.
Methods
Pregnant women from the Odense Child Cohort had phthalate metabolites measured in urine samples during 3rd trimester in 2010 to 2012. In addition, phthalates were also measured in urine samples from their offspring at age 7 years. IQ was assessed at age 7 years using four subtests from Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. The total study population consisted of 585 mother-child pairs with available prenatal urinary phthalate metabolites concentrations and IQ data at age 7 years. A subset of those (N = 274) had urinary phthalate metabolites measured in child urine at age 7 years. Phthalate concentrations were grouped into tertiles and associations with IQ were investigated using multiple linear regression adjusting for sex, maternal education and maternal/child BMI.
Results
Urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations both in pregnant women and children were generally lower compared to previous cohorts. Children with high prenatal urinary concentrations of MEP and metabolites of DEHP (∑DEHPm)(3rd tertile) had −3.1 (95\% CI: −5.5, −0.6) (MEP) and − 3.0 (−5.5, −0.6) (∑DEHPm) IQ points at age 7 years compared to children with low concentrations (1st tertile). High concurrent urinary phthalate concentrations of MCPP, ∑DnHxPm, ∑DiDPm and ∑DiNPm in the 3rd tertile was associated with −3.7 (−7.2, −0.2), −4.4 (−7.9, −0.9), −3.7 (−7.2, −0.2) and − 5.6 (−9.1, −2.2) IQ points, respectively, compared to those with the lowest concentrations (1st tertile).
Conclusion
We found significant inverse associations between some prenatal and concurrent urinary phthalate concentrations and IQ at age 7 years in this low exposed population. This suggests that exposure to phthalates both prenatally and during early childhood could be hazardous to child neurodevelopment, however, large-scale prospective studies assessing phthalate exposure through multiple urine samples, and possibly investigating cocktail effects of the chemicals as well as long term follow-up are warranted.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Gestational exposure to chemical mixtures, which is prevalent among pregnant women, may be associated with adverse childhood neurodevelopment. However, few studies have examined relations between gestational chemical mixture exposure and children's cognitive abilities.
Methods
In a cohort of 253 pregnant women and their children from Cincinnati, OH (enrolled 2003–2006), we quantified biomarker concentrations of 43 metals, phthalates, phenols, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluoroalkyl substances, and environmental tobacco smoke in blood or urine. Using k-means clustering and principal component (PC) analysis, we characterized chemical mixtures among pregnant women. We assessed children's cognitive abilities using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV at ages 5 and 8 years, respectively. We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in children's cognitive ability scores ]=cross clusters, and with increasing PC scores and individual biomarker concentrations.
Results
Geometric mean biomarker concentrations were generally highest, intermediate, and lowest among women in clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Children born to women in clusters 1 and 2 had 5.1 (95\% CI: 9.4,-0.8) and 2.0 (95\% CI: 5.5, 1,4) lower performance IQ scores compared to children in cluster 3, respectively. PC scores and individual chemical biomarker concentrations were not associated with cognitive abilities.
Conclusions
In this cohort, combined prenatal exposure to phenols, certain phthalates, pesticides, and perfluoroalkyl substances was inversely associated with children's cognition, but some individual chemical biomarker concentrations were not. Additional studies should determine if the aggregate impact of these chemicals on cognition is different from their individual effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that prenatal exposure to phthalates, ubiquitous synthetic chemicals, may adversely aﬀect neurodevelopment. However, data are limited on how phthalates aﬀect cognition, executive function, and behavioral function into adolescence.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate associations of prenatal phthalate exposure with neurodevelopment in childhood and adolescence in the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) study.
METHODS: We examined associations between maternal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations measured twice during pregnancy and a range of neurodevelopmental outcomes from ages 7 through 16 y in the CHAMACOS birth cohort (n = 334). We used age-speciﬁc linear regression models and generalized estimating equation models to assess longitudinal eﬀects and examined diﬀerences by sex.
RESULTS: Phthalate metabolites were detected in 88\%–100\% of samples, depending on the metabolite. Associations of phthalates with neurodevelopmental outcomes were largely null with some noteworthy patterns. Higher prenatal concentrations of metabolites of low-molecular weight phthalates (RLMW) were associated with more self-reported hyperactivity [b = 0:8, 95\% conﬁdence interval (CI): 0.1, 1.4 per 2-fold increase in RLMW phthalates], attention problems (b = 1:5, 95\% CI: 0.7, 2.2), and anxiety (b = 0:9, 95\% CI: 0.0, 1.8) at age 16. We observed sex-speciﬁc diﬀerences for the sums of high-molecular-weight and di(2-ethylhexyl) metabolites and cognitive outcomes (e.g., b for Full-Scale IQ for boys = − 1:9, 95\% CI: −4:1, 0.3 and −1:7, 95\% CI: −3:8, 0.3, respectively; b for girls = 1:8, 95\% CI: 0.1, 3.4 and 1.6, 95\% CI: 0.0, 3.2, respectively; p-int = 0:01 for both).
CONCLUSION: We found predominantly null associations of prenatal phthalates with neurodevelopment in CHAMACOS, and weak associations of RLMW phthalates with internalizing and externalizing behaviors in adolescence. No previous studies have examined associations of prenatal phthalate exposure with neurodevelopment into adolescence, an important time for manifestations of eﬀects. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5165},

	abstract = {Exposure to phthalates, used as plasticizers and solvents in consumer products, is ubiquitous. Despite growing concerns regarding their neurotoxicity, brain differences associated with gestational exposure to phthalates are understudied. We included 775 mother-child pairs from Generation R, a population-based pediatric neuroimaging study with prenatal recruitment, who had data on maternal gestational phthalate levels and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in children at age 10 years. Maternal urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites were measured at early, mid-, and late pregnancy. Child IQ was assessed at age 14 years. We investigated the extent to which prenatal exposure to phthalates is associated with brain volumetric measures and whether brain structural measures mediate the association of prenatal phthalate exposure with IQ. We found that higher maternal concentrations of monoethyl phthalate (mEP, averaged across pregnancy) were associated with smaller total gray matter volumes in offspring at age 10 years (β per log10 increase in creatinine adjusted mEP = −10.7, 95\%CI: −18.12, −3.28). Total gray matter volumes partially mediated the association between higher maternal mEP and lower child IQ (β for mediated path =−0.31, 95\%CI: −0.62, 0.01, p = 0.05, proportion mediated = 18\%). An association of higher monoisobutyl phthalate (mIBP) and smaller cerebral white matter volumes was present only in girls, with cerebral white matter volumes mediating the association between higher maternal mIBP and lower IQ in girls. Our findings suggest the global impact of prenatal phthalate exposure on brain volumetric measures that extends into adolescence and underlies less optimal cognitive development.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Gestational exposure to chemical mixtures, which is prevalent among pregnant women, may be associated with adverse childhood neurodevelopment. However, few studies have examined relations between gestational chemical mixture exposure and children's cognitive abilities.
Methods
In a cohort of 253 pregnant women and their children from Cincinnati, OH (enrolled 2003–2006), we quantified biomarker concentrations of 43 metals, phthalates, phenols, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluoroalkyl substances, and environmental tobacco smoke in blood or urine. Using k-means clustering and principal component (PC) analysis, we characterized chemical mixtures among pregnant women. We assessed children's cognitive abilities using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV at ages 5 and 8 years, respectively. We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in children's cognitive ability scores ]=cross clusters, and with increasing PC scores and individual biomarker concentrations.
Results
Geometric mean biomarker concentrations were generally highest, intermediate, and lowest among women in clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Children born to women in clusters 1 and 2 had 5.1 (95\% CI: 9.4,-0.8) and 2.0 (95\% CI: 5.5, 1,4) lower performance IQ scores compared to children in cluster 3, respectively. PC scores and individual chemical biomarker concentrations were not associated with cognitive abilities.
Conclusions
In this cohort, combined prenatal exposure to phenols, certain phthalates, pesticides, and perfluoroalkyl substances was inversely associated with children's cognition, but some individual chemical biomarker concentrations were not. Additional studies should determine if the aggregate impact of these chemicals on cognition is different from their individual effects.},

	abstract = {Background
Most previous studies investigating the associations between prenatal exposure to phthalates and fetal growth relied on measurements of phthalate metabolites at a single time point. They also focused on weight at birth without assessing growth over pregnancy, preventing the identification of potential periods of fetal vulnerability. We examined the associations between pregnancy urinary phthalate metabolites and fetal growth outcomes measured twice during pregnancy and at birth.
Methods
For 484 pregnant women, we assessed 13 phthalate and two 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, diisononyl ester (DINCH) metabolite concentrations from two within-subject weekly pools of up to 21 urine samples (median of 18 and 34 gestational weeks, respectively). Fetal biparietal diameter, femur length, head and abdominal circumferences were measured during two routine pregnancy follow-up ultrasonographies (median 22 and 32 gestational weeks, respectively) and estimated fetal weight (EFW) was calculated. Newborn weight, length, and head circumference were measured at birth. Associations between phthalate/DINCH metabolite and growth parameters were investigated using adjusted linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression models.
Results
Detection rates were above 99 \% for all phthalate/DINCH metabolites. While no association was observed with birth measurements, mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP) and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) were positively associated with most fetal growth parameters measured at the second trimester. Specifically, MiBP was positively associated with biparietal diameter, head and abdominal circumferences, while MnBP was positively associated with EFW, head and abdominal circumferences, with stronger associations among males. Pregnancy MnBP was positively associated with biparietal diameter and femur length at third trimester. Mixture of phthalate/DINCH metabolites was positively associated with EFW at second trimester.
Conclusions
In this pregnancy cohort using repeated urine samples to assess exposure, MiBP and MnBP were associated with increased fetal growth parameters. Further investigation on the effects of phthalates on child health would be relevant for expanding current knowledge on their long-term effects.},

              Methods:
              We measured concentrations of two bisphenols, four parabens, benzophenone-3, and triclosan in 478 pregnant women in two weekly pools of 21 samples each, collected at 18 and 34 gestational weeks. We used adjusted linear regressions to study associations between phenol concentrations and growth outcomes assessed twice during pregnancy and at birth.
            
            
              Results:
              Benzophenone-3 was positively associated with all ultrasound growth parameters in at least one time point, in males but not females. In females, butylparaben was negatively associated with third-trimester abdominal circumference and weight at birth. We observed isolated associations for triclosan (negative) and for methylparaben and bisphenol S (positive) and late pregnancy fetal growth.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Our results suggest associations between prenatal exposure to phenols and fetal growth. Benzophenone-3 was the exposure most consistently (positively) associated across all growth parameters.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ambient temperature, particularly heat, is increasingly acknowledged as a trigger for preterm delivery but study designs have been limited and results mixed. We aimed to comprehensively evaluate the association between ambient temperature throughout pregnancy and preterm delivery.
METHODS: We estimated daily temperature throughout pregnancy using a cutting-edge spatiotemporal model for 5347 live singleton births from three prospective cohorts in France, 2002-2018. We performed Cox regression (survival analysis) with distributed lags to evaluate time-varying associations with preterm birth simultaneously controlling for exposure during the first 26 weeks and last 30 days of pregnancy. We examined weekly mean, daytime, night-time and variability of temperature, and heatwaves accounting for adaptation to location and season.
RESULTS: Preterm birth risk was higher following cold (5th vs 50th percentile of mean temperature) 7-9 weeks after conception [relative risk (RR): 1.3, 95\% CI: 1.0-1.6 for 2°C vs 11.6°C] and 10-4 days before delivery (RR: 1.6, 95\% CI: 1.1-2.1 for 1.2°C vs 12.1°C). Night-time heat (95th vs 50th percentile of minimum temperature; 15.7°C vs 7.4°C) increased risk when exposure occurred within 5 weeks of conception (RR: 2.0, 95\% CI: 1.05-3.8) or 20-26 weeks after conception (RR: 2.9, 95\% CI: 1.2-6.8). Overall and daytime heat (high mean and maximum temperature) showed consistent effects. We found no clear associations with temperature variability or heatwave indicators, suggesting they may be less relevant for preterm birth.
CONCLUSIONS: In a temperate climate, night-time heat and chronic and acute cold exposures were associated with increased risk of preterm birth. These results suggest night-time heat as a relevant indicator. In the context of rising temperatures and more frequent weather hazards, these results should inform public health policies to reduce the growing burden of preterm births.},

	abstract = {Individuals are exposed to a large number of diverse environmental chemicals simultaneously and the evaluation of multiple chemical exposures is important for identifying cancer risk factors. The measurement of a large number of chemicals (the exposome) in epidemiologic studies is allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of cancer risk factors than was done in earlier studies that focused on only a few chemicals. Empirical evidence from epidemiologic studies shows that chemicals from different chemical classes have different magnitudes and directions of association with cancers. Given increasing data availability, there is a need for the development and assessment of statistical methods to model environmental cancer risk that considers a large number of diverse chemicals with different effects for different chemical classes. The method of grouped weighted quantile sum (GWQS) regression allows for multiple groups of chemicals to be considered in the model such that different magnitudes and directions of associations are possible for each group of chemicals. In this paper, we assessed the ability of GWQS regression to estimate exposure effects for multiple chemical groups and correctly identify important chemicals in each group using a simulation study. We compared the performance of GWQS regression with WQS regression, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), and the group lasso in estimating exposure effects and identifying important chemicals. The simulation study results demonstrate that GWQS is an effective method for modeling exposure to multiple groups of chemicals and compares favorably with other methods used in mixture analysis. As an application, we used GWQS regression in the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS), a population-based case-control study of childhood leukemia in California to estimate exposure effects for many chemical classes while also adjusting for demographic factors. The CCLS analysis found evidence of a positive association between exposure to the herbicide dacthal and an increased risk of childhood leukemia.},

	abstract = {The exposome recognizes that individuals are exposed simultaneously to a multitude of different environmental factors and takes a holistic approach to the discovery of etiological factors for disease. However, challenges arise when trying to quantify the health effects of complex exposure mixtures. Analytical challenges include dealing with high dimensionality, studying the combined effects of these exposures and their interactions, integrating causal pathways, and integrating high-throughput omics layers. To tackle these challenges, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) held a data challenge event open to researchers from all over the world and from all expertises. Analysts had a chance to compete and apply state-of-the-art methods on a common partially simulated exposome dataset (based on real case data from the HELIX project) with multiple correlated exposure variables (P {\textgreater} 100 exposure variables) arising from general and personal environments at different time points, biological molecular data (multi-omics: DNA methylation, gene expression, proteins, metabolomics) and multiple clinical phenotypes in 1301 mother–child pairs. Most of the methods presented included feature selection or feature reduction to deal with the high dimensionality of the exposome dataset. Several approaches explicitly searched for combined effects of exposures and/or their interactions using linear index models or response surface methods, including Bayesian methods. Other methods dealt with the multi-omics dataset in mediation analyses using multiple-step approaches. Here we discuss features of the statistical models used and provide the data and codes used, so that analysts have examples of implementation and can learn how to use these methods. Overall, the exposome data challenge presented a unique opportunity for researchers from different disciplines to create and share state-of-the-art analytical methods, setting a new standard for open science in the exposome and environmental health field.},

	abstract = {Background:
Exposure mixtures frequently occur in data across many domains, particularly in the fields of environmental and nutritional epidemiology. Various strategies have arisen to answer questions about exposure mixtures, including methods such as weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression that estimate a joint effect of the mixture components.
Objectives:
We demonstrate a new approach to estimating the joint effects of a mixture: quantile g-computation. This approach combines the inferential simplicity of WQS regression with the flexibility of g-computation, a method of causal effect estimation. We use simulations to examine whether quantile g-computation and WQS regression can accurately and precisely estimate the effects of mixtures in a variety of common scenarios.
Methods:
We examine the bias, confidence interval (CI) coverage, and bias–variance tradeoff of quantile g-computation and WQS regression and how these quantities are impacted by the presence of noncausal exposures, exposure correlation, unmeasured confounding, and nonlinearity of exposure effects.
Results:
Quantile g-computation, unlike WQS regression, allows inference on mixture effects that is unbiased with appropriate CI coverage at sample sizes typically encountered in epidemiologic studies and when the assumptions of WQS regression are not met. Further, WQS regression can magnify bias from unmeasured confounding that might occur if important components of the mixture are omitted from the analysis.
Discussion:
Unlike inferential approaches that examine the effects of individual exposures while holding other exposures constant, methods like quantile g-computation that can estimate the effect of a mixture are essential for understanding the effects of potential public health actions that act on exposure sources.

Seven census tract level characteristics of participants’ residential environment were assessed and grouped as follows: economic, education, health care access, neighborhood conditions, social environment, transportation, and clean environment. Generalized estimating equation models were performed, to take into account the clustered nature of the data and to estimate β or relative risk (RR) and 95 \% confidence intervals (CIs) between each of the seven environmental characteristics and cardiometabolic outcomes. Quantile g-computation was used to examine the association between the joint effect of a simultaneous increase in all environmental characteristics and cardiometabolic outcomes. Among 570 participants (mean age 58.8 ± 11 years), environmental economic, educational and health characteristics were individually associated with insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. In the mixture analyses, a joint quartile increase in all environmental characteristics (i.e., improvement) was associated with decreasing insulin resistance (β, 95 \%CI: −0.09, −0.18–0.01)), risk of diabetes (RR, 95 \%CI: 0.59, 0.36–0.98) and obesity (RR, 95 \%CI: 0.81, 0.64–1.02).

	abstract = {Background:
Exposure mixtures frequently occur in data across many domains, particularly in the fields of environmental and nutritional epidemiology. Various strategies have arisen to answer questions about exposure mixtures, including methods such as weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression that estimate a joint effect of the mixture components.

Objectives:
We demonstrate a new approach to estimating the joint effects of a mixture: quantile g-computation. This approach combines the inferential simplicity of WQS regression with the flexibility of g-computation, a method of causal effect estimation. We use simulations to examine whether quantile g-computation and WQS regression can accurately and precisely estimate the effects of mixtures in a variety of common scenarios.

Methods:
We examine the bias, confidence interval (CI) coverage, and bias–variance tradeoff of quantile g-computation and WQS regression and how these quantities are impacted by the presence of noncausal exposures, exposure correlation, unmeasured confounding, and nonlinearity of exposure effects.

Results:
Quantile g-computation, unlike WQS regression, allows inference on mixture effects that is unbiased with appropriate CI coverage at sample sizes typically encountered in epidemiologic studies and when the assumptions of WQS regression are not met. Further, WQS regression can magnify bias from unmeasured confounding that might occur if important components of the mixture are omitted from the analysis.

Discussion:
Unlike inferential approaches that examine the effects of individual exposures while holding other exposures constant, methods like quantile g-computation that can estimate the effect of a mixture are essential for understanding the effects of potential public health actions that act on exposure sources.

Our simulations are in the context of a binary treatment, a binary outcome and baseline confounders.

          The parametric g-formula can be used to estimate the effect of a policy, intervention, or treatment. Unlike standard regression approaches, the parametric g-formula can be used to adjust for time-varying confounders that are affected by prior exposures. To date, there are few published examples in which the method has been applied.
          Methods: 
          We provide a simple introduction to the parametric g-formula and illustrate its application in an analysis of a small cohort study of bone marrow transplant patients in which the effect of treatment on mortality is subject to time-varying confounding.
          Results: 
          Standard regression adjustment yields a biased estimate of the effect of treatment on mortality relative to the estimate obtained by the g-formula.
          Conclusions: 
          The g-formula allows estimation of a relevant parameter for public health officials: the change in the hazard of mortality under a hypothetical intervention, such as reduction of exposure to a harmful agent or introduction of a beneficial new treatment. We present a simple approach to implement the parametric g-formula that is sufficiently general to allow easy adaptation to many settings of public health relevance.},

	abstract = {There has been a growing interest in the literature on multiple environmental risk factors for diseases and an increasing emphasis on assessing multiple environmental exposures simultaneously in epidemiologic studies of cancer. One method used to analyze exposure to multiple chemical exposures is weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression. While WQS regression has been demonstrated to have good sensitivity and specificity when identifying important exposures, it has limitations including a two-step model fitting process that decreases power and model stability and a requirement that all exposures in the weighted index have associations in the same direction with the outcome, which is not realistic when chemicals in different classes have different directions and magnitude of association with a health outcome. Grouped WQS (GWQS) was proposed to allow for multiple groups of chemicals in the model where different magnitude and direction of associations are possible for each group. However, GWQS shares the limitation of WQS of a two-step estimation process and splitting of data into training and validation sets. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian group index model to avoid the estimation limitation of GWQS while having multiple exposure indices in the model. To evaluate the performance of the Bayesian group index model, we conducted a simulation study with several different exposure scenarios. We also applied the Bayesian group index method to analyze childhood leukemia risk in the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS). The results showed that the Bayesian group index model had slightly better power for exposure effects and specificity and sensitivity in identifying important chemical exposure components compared with the existing frequentist method, particularly for small sample sizes. In the application to the CCLS, we found a significant negative association for insecticides, with the most important chemical being carbaryl. In addition, for children who were born and raised in the home where dust samples were taken, there was a significant positive association for herbicides with dacthal being the most important exposure. In conclusion, our approach of the Bayesian group index model appears able to make a substantial contribution to the field of environmental epidemiology.},

Previous studies found associations between individual PFAS and bone mineral density in adults but did not analyze their combined effects.
OBJECTIVE: To extend weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to a Bayesian framework (Bayesian extension of the WQS regression [BWQS]) and determine the association between a mixture of serum PFAS and mineral density in lumbar spine, total, and neck femur in 499 adults from the 2013 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
METHODS: We used BWQS to assess the combined association of eight PFAS, as a mixture, with bone mineral density in adults. As secondary analyses, we focused on vulnerable populations (men over 50 years and postmenopausal women). Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic factors. Sensitivity analyses included bone mineral density associations with individual compounds and results from WQS regressions.
RESULTS: The mean age was 55 years old (SD = 1) with average spine, total, and neck femur mineral densities of 1.01 (SD = 0.01), 0.95 (SD = 0.01), and 0.78 (SD = 0.01) gm/cm2, respectively. PFAS mixture levels showed no evidence of association with mineral density (spine: β = -0.004; 95\% credible interval [CrI] = -0.04, 0.04; total femur: β = 0.002; 95\% CrI = -0.04, 0.05; femur neck: β = 0.005; 95\%CrI = -0.03, 0.04) in the overall population. Results were also null in vulnerable populations. Findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: We introduced a Bayesian extension of WQS and found no evidence of the association between PFAS mixture and bone mineral density.},

Researchers have used weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to estimate the effect of multiple exposures in a manner that identifies the important (etiologically relevant) components in the mixture. However, complications arise when an experimental apparatus detects concentrations for each chemical with a different detection limit. Current strategies to account for values below the detection limit (BDL) in WQS include single imputation or placing the BDL values into the first quantile of the weighted index (BDLQ1), which do not fully capture the uncertainty in the data when estimating mixture effects. In response, we integrated WQS regression into the multiple imputation framework (MI-WQS). In a simulation study, we compared the BDLQ1 approach to MI-WQS when using either a Bayesian imputation or bootstrapping imputation approach over a range of BDL values. We examined the ability of each method to estimate the mixture's overall effect and to identify important chemicals. The results showed that as the number of BDL values increased, the accuracy, precision, model fit, and power declined for all imputation approaches. When chemical values were missing at 10\%, 33\%, or 50\%, the MI approaches generally performed better than single imputation and BDLQ1. In the extreme case of 80\% of all the chemical values were missing, the BDLQ1 approach was superior in some examined metrics.},

We evaluate and characterize the accuracy of WQS regression in variable selection through extensive simulation studies through sensitivity and specificity (i.e., ability of the WQS method to select the bad actors correctly and not incorrect ones). We demonstrate the improvement in accuracy this method provides over traditional ordinary regression and shrinkage methods (lasso, adaptive lasso, and elastic net). Results from simulations demonstrate that WQS regression is accurate under some environmentally relevant conditions, but its accuracy decreases for a fixed correlation pattern as the association with a response variable diminishes. Nonzero weights (i.e., weights exceeding a selection threshold parameter) may be used to identify bad actors; however, components within a cluster of highly correlated active components tend to have lower weights, with the sum of their weights representative of the set.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Individuals are exposed to many diverse chemicals and it is important to estimate
the relationship between many chemical exposures and cancer risk. The method of weighted
quantile sum (WQS) regression estimates a single weighted linear index of correlated
components and its association with a health outcome. WQS performs well in simulation
studies in identifying the important components of a chemical mixture, however, the
chemicals in the index are constrained to have either effects in the same direction
or no effect and the application of WQS is limited to settings where it is reasonable
to combine all chemicals into a single index. In order to allow chemicals to have
associations in different directions with the outcome, we present the method of grouped
weighted quantile sum (GWQS) regression.
Methods: We develop an approach to model many chemical exposures from different chemical
classes jointly and apply it to a case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
in four geographically distinct National Cancer Institute-Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results centers (Detroit; Iowa; Los Angeles; Seattle). The study contains concentrations
of 5 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 7 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
and 15 pesticides measured in residential house dust. We consider different approaches
to specifying the group memberships for chemicals and compare the goodness-of-fit
of the approaches.
Results: We found evidence of a directional change in the association between NHL and select
pesticides across study sites (e.g., negative for 2,4-D and dicamba in Iowa and Seattle)
and performed grouped WQS in each study center using site-specific groupings of pesticides
to create both a positive and negative pesticide index along with an index for PCBs
and PAHs. There was a positive association between PCBs and NHL.
Conclusions: GWQS regression extends WQS regression to have a more flexible and realistic specification
of chemical mixture effects.},

The measurement of a large number of chemicals (the exposome) in epidemiologic studies is allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of cancer risk factors than was done in earlier studies that focused on only a few chemicals. Empirical evidence from epidemiologic studies shows that chemicals from different chemical classes have different magnitudes and directions of association with cancers.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Benzophenones (BPs), parabens, and triclosan (TCS) are widely used in personal care products and may be neurotoxic to children, but limited studies have estimated the associations between exposure to these potential endocrine disrupting chemicals during pregnancy and child neurocognitive development.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the relationships of prenatal exposure to BPs, parabens and TCS with child neurocognitive development at age 2.
METHODS: From 2014 to 2015, 478 mother-child pairs from a longitudinal prenatal cohort in China were included in present study. We quantified BPs, parabens and TCS in three spot urine samples during pregnancy (in the first, second, and third trimester). The Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) test to children was performed at 2 years. Multivariate linear regression models and generalized estimating equations were used to examine changes in mental developmental index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) per 2-fold increase in averaged and trimester-specific maternal urinary phenols, respectively.
RESULTS: In the adjusted models, each 2-fold increase in average prenatal paraben concentration was associated with lower MDI scores among girls [-1.08 (95\% CI: -2.10, -0.06) and - 1.51 (95\% CI: -2.69, -0.32) for methyl paraben (Mep) and Σparabens, respectively], but the association was not statistically significant among boys [-0.24 (95\% CI: -1.46, 0.99), Psex-int = 0.37 and 0.18 (95\% CI: -1.28, 1.64), Psex-int = 0.10 for Mep and Σparabens, respectively]. Increasing urinary 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4-OH-BP) concentration was associated with lower PDI scores among boys [-2.96 (95\% CI: -4.48, -1.45)], not girls [-0.07 (95\% CI: -1.57, 1.43)] and the association was significantly different in boys and girls (Psex-int = 0.01). No significant associations were observed between the average prenatal TCS exposure and BSID results. In trimester-specific analyses, increasing parabens was associated with lower girls' MDI only in the second trimester, while increasing 4-OH-BP was associated with lower boys' PDI in each trimester.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that prenatal exposure to BPs and parabens may be associated with impairment in child cognitive abilities at 2 years. Further human and animal studies are needed to verify our results and elucidate the biological mechanisms involved in these associations.},

	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Are in-utero or peripubertal exposures to phthalates, parabens and other phenols found in personal care products associated with timing of pubertal onset in boys and girls?
SUMMARY ANSWER: We found some associations of altered pubertal timing in girls, but little evidence in boys.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Certain chemicals in personal care and consumer products, including low molecular weight phthalates, parabens and phenols, or their precursors, are associated with altered pubertal timing in animal studies.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Data were from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) longitudinal cohort study which followed 338 children in the Salinas Valley, California, from before birth to adolescence.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Pregnant women were enrolled in 1999-2000. Mothers were mostly Latina, living below the federal poverty threshold and without a high school diploma. We measured concentrations of three phthalate metabolites (monoethyl phthalate [MEP], mono-n-butyl phthalate and mono-isobutyl phthalate), methyl and propyl paraben and four other phenols (triclosan, benzophenone-3 and 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenol) in urine collected from mothers during pregnancy and from children at age 9. Pubertal timing was assessed among 179 girls and 159 boys every 9 months between ages 9 and 13 using clinical Tanner staging. Accelerated failure time models were used to obtain mean shifts of pubertal timing associated with concentrations of prenatal and peripubertal biomarkers.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In girls, we observed earlier onset of pubic hair development with prenatal urinary MEP concentrations and earlier menarche with prenatal triclosan and 2,4-dichlorophenol concentrations. Regarding peripubertal biomarkers, we observed: earlier breast development, pubic hair development and menarche with methyl paraben; earlier menarche with propyl paraben; and later pubic hair development with 2,5-dichlorophenol. In boys, we observed no associations with prenatal urinary biomarker concentrations and only one association with peripubertal concentrations: earlier genital development with propyl paraben.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: These chemicals are quickly metabolized and one to two urinary measurements per developmental point may not accurately reflect usual exposure. Associations of peripubertal measurements with parabens may reflect reverse causality: children going through puberty early may be more likely to use personal care products. The study population was limited to Latino children of low socioeconomic status living in a farmworker community and may not be widely generalizable.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study contributes to a growing literature that suggests that exposure to certain endocrine disrupting chemicals may impact timing of puberty in children.
STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the US Environmental Protection Agency. The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Compared with term infants, preterm infants have impaired brain development at term-equivalent age, even in the absence of structural brain injury. However, details regarding the onset and progression of impaired preterm brain development over the third trimester are unknown. Our primary objective was to compare third-trimester brain volumes and brain growth trajectories in ex utero preterm infants without structural brain injury and in healthy in utero fetuses. As a secondary objective, we examined risk factors associated with brain volumes in preterm infants over the third-trimester postconception.

METHODS:
Preterm infants born before 32 weeks of gestational age (GA) and weighing {\textless}1500 g with no evidence of structural brain injury on conventional MRI and healthy pregnant women were prospectively recruited. Anatomic T2-weighted brain images of preterm infants and healthy fetuses were parcellated into the following regions: cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and intracranial cavity.

RESULTS:
We studied 205 participants (75 preterm infants and 130 healthy control fetuses) between 27 and 39 weeks’ GA. Third-trimester brain volumes were reduced and brain growth trajectories were slower in the ex utero preterm group compared with the in utero healthy fetuses in the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and intracranial cavity. Clinical risk factors associated with reduced brain volumes included dexamethasone treatment, the presence of extra-axial blood on brain MRI, confirmed sepsis, and duration of oxygen support.

CONCLUSIONS:
These preterm infants exhibited impaired third-trimester global and regional brain growth in the absence of cerebral/cerebellar parenchymal injury detected by using conventional MRI.},

	abstract = {The prefrontal cortex is essential for both executive function and emotional regulation. The interrelationships among these behavioral domains are increasingly recognized, as well as their sensitivity to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). Prefrontal cortex receives serotonergic inputs from the dorsal and median raphe nuclei and is modulated by multiple subtypes of 5-HT receptor across its layers and cell types. Extremes of serotonergic modulation alter mood regulation in vulnerable individuals, yet the impact of serotonin under more typical physiological parameters remains unclear. In this regard, new tools are permitting a closer examination of the behavioral impact of the serotonin system. Optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons reveal that serotonin has a greater impact on executive function than previously appreciated. Domains that appear sensitive to fluctuations in 5-HT neuronal excitability include patience and cognitive flexibility. This work is broadly consistent with ex vivo research investigating how 5-HT regulates prefrontal cortex and its output projections. A growing literature suggests 5-HT modulation of these prefrontal circuits is unexpectedly flexible to alteration during development by genetic, behavioral, environmental or pharmacological manipulations, with lasting repercussions for cognition and emotional regulation. Here, we review the cellular and circuit mechanisms of prefrontal serotonergic modulation, investigate recent research into the cognitive consequences of the serotonergic system, and probe the lasting consequences of developmental perturbations. Understanding both the complexity of the prefrontal serotonin system and its sensitivity during development are essential to learn more about the vulnerabilities of this system in mood and anxiety disorders and the underappreciated cognitive consequences of these disorders and their treatment.},

The PFC is the last brain region to mature and development in this area proceeds into the fourth decade of life.

More research is needed to evaluate the associations between exposure to individual BPA alternatives and neurodevelopmental outcomes in humans.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at examining the individual associations between prenatal BPA, BPS and BPF exposure and cognitive outcomes in children at age 7 years.
METHOD: Women were enrolled in the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal Mother and Child, Asthma and Allergy (SELMA) study, at gestational median week 10.0, and their children were examined for cognitive function at 7 years of age (N = 803). Maternal urinary BPA, BPS, and BPF concentrations were measured at enrollment and childreńs cognitive function at the age of 7 years was measured using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children IV (WISC-IV).
RESULTS: All three bisphenols were detected in over 90\% of the women, where BPA had the highest geometric mean concentrations (1.55 ng/mL), followed by BPF (0.16 ng/mL) and BPS (0.07 ng/mL). Prenatal BPF exposure was associated with decreased full scale IQ (β = -1.96, 95\%CI; -3.12; -0.80), as well as with a decrease in all four sub scales covering verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory and processing speed. This association corresponded to a 1.6-point lower IQ score for an inter-quartile-range (IQR) change in prenatal BPF exposure (IQR = 0.054-0.350 ng/mL). In sex-stratified analyses, significant associations with full scale IQ were found for boys (β = -2.86, 95\%CI; -4.54; -1.18), while the associations for girls did not reach significance (β = -1.38, 95\%CI; -2.97; 0.22). No significant associations between BPA nor BPS and cognition were found.
DISCUSSION: Prenatal exposure to BPF was significantly associated with childreńs cognitive function at 7 years. Since BPF is replacing BPA in numerous consumer products globally, this finding urgently call for further studies.},

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) represent a large group of exogenous chemicals with the capacity of interfering with endocrine functions. In different population-based settings, associations between exposure to EDCs, particularly in prenatal life, and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes have been demonstrated. These findings are strengthened by numerous experimental studies. Although mechanisms underlying these associations are not entirely delineated, disruption of thyroid hormone and, to a lesser extent, sex hormone signalling have been shown to be involved. Humans are constantly exposed to mixtures of EDCs, and further research combining epidemiological and experimental settings is required to improve our understanding of the link between real-life exposures to these chemicals and their impact on neurodevelopment.},

	abstract = {Although the toxicity of synthetic chemicals at high doses is well known, chronic exposure to low-dose chemical mixtures has only recently been linked to many age-related diseases. However, it is nearly impossible to avoid the exposure to these low-dose chemical mixtures as humans are exposed to a myriad of synthetic chemicals as a part of their daily lives. Therefore, coping with possible harms due to low dose chemical mixtures is challenging. Interestingly, within the range of environmental exposure, disease risk does not increase linearly with increasing dose of chemicals, but often tends to plateau or even decrease with increasing dose. Hormesis, the over-compensation of various adaptive responses through cellular stresses, is one possible mechanism for this non-linearity. Although the hormetic effects of synthetic chemicals or radiation have long been debated in the field of toxicology, the hormesis concept has recently been generalized in the field of molecular biology; similar to responses to synthetic chemicals, mild to moderate intermittent stressors from any source can induce hormetic responses. Examples of stressors are exercise, calorie restriction, intermittent fasting, cognitive stimulation, and phytochemicals. Mitohormesis is hormesis induced by such stressors through mitochondrial retrograde signalling including the increased production of mild reactive oxygen species. Xenohormesis is phytochemical-induced hormesis, reflective of a mutualistic relationship between plant and animals. As humans had repeated exposure to all of these stressors during their evolution, the hormetic effects of these health behaviours may be considered to be evolutionarily adapted. Although hormesis induced by synthetic chemicals occurs in humans, such hormesis may not be recommended to the public due to unresolved issues on safety including the impossibility of control exposure. However, the use of personal health behaviors which enhance mitohormetic- or xenohormetic-stress can be readily incorporated into everyone's daily lives as a practical way to counteract harmful effects of unavoidable low-dose chemical mixtures.},

	abstract = {Exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is linked to many chronic diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Among several possible mechanisms are gradual glutathione depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction after chronic exposure to very low doses of POP mixtures. However, it is biologically noteworthy that glutathione status and mitochondrial function is subject to hormesis, defined broadly as mild stress-induced stimulation of cellular protective mechanisms, including increased synthesis of glutathione and promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis. Although high levels of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS) can cause cellular damage, certain levels of ROS function as signalling molecules to induce hormetic effects. Thus, similar to many other stressors generating ROS, glutathione status and mitochondrial function can be improved at higher POP doses. However, higher POP levels are dangerous despite their hormetic effects due to other adverse phenomena. Also, the persistent nature of POPs can make hormetic effects less effective in humans as hormesis may be the most active with transient stressors. Hormesis-inducing stressors should be placed into three categories for public health purposes: (1) disadvantageous: chemicals like POPs and radiation, that could harm humans by endocrine disruption, action of chemical mixtures and susceptible populations; (2) neutral: cold, heat, and gravity; and (3) advantageous: moderate exercise, phytochemical intake, and calorie restriction. Noting that regulation of POPs, while critical, has provided insufficient protection because POPs persist in human bodies and the food chain, advantageous stressors should be used by the public to mitigate glutathione depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction due to POPs.},

	abstract = {Background
There is inconsistent evidence regarding the sex-specific associations between prenatal phthalate exposure and children’s neurodevelopment. This could be due to differences in the phthalate exposures investigated and the neurodevelopmental domains assessed.
Objective
To evaluate the associations between prenatal phthalate exposure and sex-specific outcomes on measures of cognition, language, motor, executive function, and behaviour in children 2 years of age in the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) cohort.
Methods
We evaluated the associations between prenatal phthalate exposure and sex-specific neurodevelopmental outcomes in children at 2 years of age using data from 448 mothers and their children (222 girls, 226 boys). Nine phthalate metabolites were measured in maternal urine collected in the second trimester of pregnancy. Children’s cognitive, language, and motor outcomes were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development – Third Edition (Bayley-III). Parents completed questionnaires on children’s executive function and behavior, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function- Preschool Version (BRIEF-P) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), respectively. Sex-stratified robust multivariate regressions were performed.
Results
Higher maternal concentrations of ΣDEHP and its metabolites were associated with lower scores on the Bayley-III Cognitive (β’s from −11.8 to −0.07 95\% CI’s from −21.3 to −0.01), Language (β’s from −11.7 to −0. 09, 95\% CI’s from −22.3 to −0.02) and Motor (β’s from −10.9 to −0.07, 95\% CI from −20.4 to -0.01) composites in boys. The patterns of association in girls were in the opposite direction on the Cognitive and Language composites; on the Motor composite they were in the same direction as boys, but of reduced strength. Higher concentrations of ΣDEHP and its metabolites were associated with higher scores (i.e., more difficulties) on all measures of executive function in girls: inhibitory self-control (B’s from 0.05 to 0.11, 95\% CI s from −0.01 to 0.15), flexibility (B’s from 0.04 to 0.11, 95\% CI s from 0.01 to 0.21) and emergent metacognition (B’s from −0.01 to 0.06, 95\% CIs from −0.01 to 0.20). Similar patterns of attenuated associations were seen in boys. Higher concentrations of ΣDEHP and its metabolites were associated with more Externalizing Problems in girls and boys (B’s from 0.03 to 6.82, 95\% CIs from −0.08 to 12.0). Two phthalates, MMP and MBP, had sex-specific adverse associations on measures of executive function and behaviour, respectively, while MEP was positively associated with boys’ cognitive, language, and motor performance. Limited associations were observed between mixtures of maternal phthalates and sex-specific neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Conclusions
Maternal prenatal concentrations of DEHP phthalates were associated with sex specific difference on measures of cognition and language at 2 years of age, specifically, poorer outcomes in boys. Higher exposure to DEHP was associated with poorer motor, executive function, and behavioural outcomes in girls and boys but the strength of these associations differed by sex. Limited associations were noted between phthalate mixtures and child neurodevelopment.},

	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Is exposure to environmental chemicals associated with modifications of placental morphology and function?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Phthalates, a class of ubiquitous chemicals, showed an association with altered placental weight, placental vascular resistance (PVR), and placental efficiency.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Only a few epidemiological studies have assessed the effects of phenols and phthalates on placental health. Their results were affected by exposure measurement errors linked to the rapid excretion of these compounds and the reliance on a limited number of spot urine samples to assess exposure.
STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: A prospective mother-child cohort, with improved exposure assessment for non-persistent chemicals, recruited participants between 2014 and 2017. Sample size ranged between 355 (placental parameters measured at birth: placental weight and placental-to-fetal weight ratio (PFR): a proxy for placental efficiency) and 426 (placental parameters measured during pregnancy: placental thickness and vascular resistance).
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: Phenols (four parabens, two bisphenols, triclosan, and benzophenone-3), 13 phthalate metabolites, and two non-phthalate plasticizer metabolites were measured in within-subject pools of repeated urine samples collected during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (median = 21 samples/trimester/woman). Placental thickness and PVR were measured during pregnancy. The placenta was weighed at birth and the PFR was computed. Both adjusted linear regression and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression were used to evaluate associations between phenols and phthalates (alone or as a mixture) and placental parameters. Effect modification by child sex was also investigated.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Several phthalate metabolites were negatively associated with placental outcomes. Monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) concentrations, during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, were associated with a decrease in both placental weight at birth (β = -20.1 g [95\% CI: -37.8; -2.5] and β = -17.4 g [95\% CI: -33.2; -1.6], for second and third trimester, respectively) and PFR (β = -0.5 [95\% CI: -1, -0.1] and β = -0.5 [95\% CI: -0.9, -0.1], for the second and third trimester, respectively). Additionally, MBzP was negatively associated with PVR during the third trimester (β= -0.9 [95\% CI: -1.8; 0.1]). Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), was negatively associated with PVR in both trimesters (β = -1.3, 95\% CI: [-2.3, -0.2], and β = -1.2, 95\% CI: [-2.4, -0.03], for the second and third trimester, respectively). After stratification for child sex, Σ diisononyl phthalate (DiNP) (either second or third-trimester exposures, depending on the outcomes considered) was associated with decreased PVR in the third trimester, as well as decreased placental weight and PFR in males. No associations were observed for phenol biomarkers.
LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: False positives cannot be ruled out. Therefore, chemicals that were associated with multiple outcomes (MnBP and DiNP) or reported in existing literature as associated with placental outcomes (MBzP) should be considered as the main results.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results are consistent with in vitro studies showing that phthalates target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, in the family of nuclear receptors involved in key placental development processes such as trophoblast proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition to placental weight at birth, we studied placental parameters during pregnancy, which could provide a broader view of how environmental chemicals affect maternal-fetal exchanges over the course of pregnancy. Our findings contribute to the increasing evidence indicating adverse impacts of phthalate exposure on placental health.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies aiming at relating exposure to phenols and phthalates with child social behavior characterized exposure using one or a few spot urine samples, resulting in substantial exposure misclassification. Moreover, early infancy exposure was rarely studied.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the associations of phthalates and phenols with child social behavior in a cohort with improved exposure assessment and to a priori identify the chemicals supported by a higher weight of evidence.
METHODS: Among 406 mother-child pairs from the French Assessment of Air Pollution exposure during Pregnancy and Effect on Health (SEPAGES) cohort, 25 phenols/phthalate metabolites were measured in within-subject pools of repeated urine samples collected at the second and third pregnancy trimesters (∼21 samples/trimester) and at 2 months and 1-year of age (∼7 samples/period). Social behavior was parent-reported at 3 years of age of the child using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). A structured literature review of the animal and human evidence was performed to prioritize the measured phthalates/phenols based on their likelihood to affect social behavior. Both adjusted linear regression and Bayesian Weighted Quantile Sum (BWQS) regression models were fitted. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied only to nonprioritized chemicals.
RESULTS: Prioritized compounds included bisphenol A, bisphenol S, triclosan (TCS), diethyl-hexyl phthalate (ΣDEHP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP). With the exception of bisphenols, which showed a mixed pattern of positive and negative associations in pregnant mothers and neonates, few prenatal associations were observed. Most associations were observed with prioritized chemicals measured in 1-y-old infants: Each doubling in urinary TCS (β=0.78; 95\% CI: 0.00, 1.55) and MEP (β=0.92; 95\% CI: -0.11, 1.96) concentrations were associated with worse total SRS scores, whereas MnBP and ΣDEHP were associated with worse Social Awareness (β=0.25; 95\% CI: 0.01, 0.50) and Social Communication (β=0.43; 95\% CI: -0.02, 0.89) scores, respectively. BWQS also suggested worse total SRS [Beta 1=1.38; 95\% credible interval (CrI): -0.18, 2.97], Social Awareness (Beta 1=0.37; 95\% CrI: 0.06, 0.70), and Social Communication (Beta 1=0.91; 95\% CrI: 0.31, 1.53) scores per quartile increase in the mixture of prioritized compounds assessed in 1-y-old infants. The few associations observed with nonprioritized chemicals did not remain after FDR correction, with the exception of benzophenone-3 exposure in 1-y-old infants, which was suggestively associated with worse Social Communication scores (corrected p=0.07).
DISCUSSION: The literature search allowed us to adapt our statistical analysis according to the weight of evidence and create a corpus of experimental and epidemiological knowledge to better interpret our findings. Early infancy appears to be a sensitive exposure window that should be further investigated. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11798.},

	abstract = {An endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) is an exogenous chemical, or mixture of chemicals, that can interfere with any aspect of hormone action. The potential for deleterious effects of EDC must be considered relative to the regulation of hormone synthesis, secretion, and actions and the variability in regulation of these events across the life cycle. The developmental age at which EDC exposures occur is a critical consideration in understanding their effects. Because endocrine systems exhibit tissue-, cell-, and receptor-specific actions during the life cycle, EDC can produce complex, mosaic effects. This complexity causes difficulty when a static approach to toxicity through endocrine mechanisms driven by rigid guidelines is used to identify EDC and manage risk to human and wildlife populations. We propose that principles taken from fundamental endocrinology be employed to identify EDC and manage their risk to exposed populations. We emphasize the importance of developmental stage and, in particular, the realization that exposure to a presumptive "safe" dose of chemical may impact a life stage when there is normally no endogenous hormone exposure, thereby underscoring the potential for very low-dose EDC exposures to have potent and irreversible effects. Finally, with regard to the current program designed to detect putative EDC, namely, the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program, we offer recommendations for strengthening this program through the incorporation of basic endocrine principles to promote further understanding of complex EDC effects, especially due to developmental exposures.},

	abstract = {Background: Few human studies have examined bisphenol A (BPA) exposure in relation to semen quality and reproductive hormones in men, and results are divergent.
Objectives: We examined associations between urinary BPA concentration and reproductive hormones, as well as semen quality, in young men from the general population.
Methods: Our study population consisted of 308 young men from the general population. Urinary BPA concentration was measured by isotope dilution TurboFlow-liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. We used multiple linear regression analysis to estimate associations between BPA concentration and reproductive hormones and semen quality, adjusting for confounding factors.
Results: We found that 98\% of the men had detectable urinary levels of BPA. Median (5th–95th percentiles) BPA concentration was 3.25 ng/mL (0.59–14.89 ng/mL). Men with BPA concentrations above the lowest quartile had higher concentrations of serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, and free testosterone compared with the lowest quartile (ptrend ≤ 0.02). Men in the highest quartile of BPA excretion had on average 18\% higher total testosterone (95\% CI: 8, 28\%), 22\% higher LH (95\% CI: 6, 39\%), and 13\% higher estradiol (95\% CI: 4, 24\%) compared with lowest quartile. Men in the highest quartile of BPA also had significantly lower percentage progressive motile spermatozoa compared with men in the lowest quartile (–6.7 percentage points, 95\% CI: –11.76, –1.63). BPA was not associated with other semen parameters. Adjusting for dietary patterns did not influence the results.
Conclusions: The pattern of associations between BPA and reproductive hormones could indicate an antiandrogenic or antiestrogenic effect, or both, of BPA on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal hormone feedback system, possibly through a competitive inhibition at the receptor level. However, additional research is needed to confirm our findings and to further test the suggested potential mechanisms.

	abstract = {Exposure to environmental phenols such as bisphenol A, benzophenones, 2-phenylphenol, triclosan, and triclocarban is of concern, because of their endocrine disrupting properties and broad application in consumer products. The current body burden of the 3–17-year-old population in Germany to these substances was assessed in first-morning void urine samples (N = 515–516) collected within the population-representative German Environmental Survey for Children and Adolescents 2014–2017 (GerES V). Bisphenol A was the most prominent phenol analysed here, ubiquitously found in almost all samples with a geometric mean (GM) concentration of 1.905 μg/L (1.669 μg/gcreatinine) and a maximum (MAX) urinary concentration of 399 μg/L. Benzophenone-3 and benzophenone-1 were quantified in 35\% and 41\% of the samples. GM was below the limit of quantification (LOQ) for benzophenone-3 and 0.559 μg/L (0.489 μg/gcrea) for benzophenone-1, MAX concentrations were 845 μg/L and 202 μg/L, respectively. In 16\% of the samples triclosan was found in quantifiable amounts resulting in a GM below LOQ and a MAX concentration of 801 μg/L. Benzophenone-8, 2-phenylphenol and triclocarban were quantified in none or only 1\% of the samples. Benzophenone-1 and -3 concentrations were found to be associated with frequent application of personal care products. A comparison with the previous cycle of the survey, GerES IV (2003–2006), showed a decrease of urinary bisphenol A concentrations, mainly in young children. Despite this decrease, the concentration of bisphenol A exceeded the human biomonitoring (HBM) value HBM-I of 0.1 mg/L in 0.11\% of the samples. For triclosan, all urinary concentrations were well below the HBM-I value of 2 mg/L. To minimise environmental health risks, it is therefore necessary to maintain a further declining trend for bisphenol A and continue monitoring the exposure to environmental phenols, as well as to monitor substitutes such as bisphenol F and S.},

	abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can disrupt fetal developmental processes during pregnancy, leading to long-term adverse outcomes in humans. A major source of exposure to EDCs, such as phthalates and bisphenols, is the food supply, primarily due to contamination from processing and packaging. Therefore, this review aimed to 1) review food-monitoring sources of phthalates and bisphenols, and 2) evaluate methodologies and provide future directions needed to establish EDC-limiting dietary recommendations in pregnancy. Using PubMed, 10 peer-reviewed studies were found on dietary predictors of EDC exposure in pregnancy, and all were selected for review. Use of plastic containers in pregnancy was associated with higher urinary phthalate metabolites, whereas canned food consumption was associated with higher urinary bisphenol A (BPA) concentrations. Foods and dietary patterns associated with healthier food choices (e.g., organic/grown/raised/caught foods, folic acid supplements, vegetarianism) were generally associated with lower urinary phthalate metabolite and BPA concentrations. Despite the many food-monitoring studies reporting high BPA and phthalate concentrations in various foods, the designs of most studies described here were not suﬃciently robust to consistently detect associations of speciﬁc foods/food groups with phthalates and BPA. Given the limitations of currently available research, future studies should incorporate more valid questionnaires to accurately assess dietary EDC exposure, strive for concurrent diet and exposure assessment, and assess whether geographical and cultural diﬀerences modify associations of diet with gestational EDC exposures. Such progress will be critical for developing dietary recommendations that ensure the safety and health of pregnant women. Adv Nutr 2019;10:803–815.},

Despite results not being always consistent, most probably due to methodological issues, it is highly probable that early life exposure to BPA or/and phthalates, affects various aspects of behaviour in the offspring. Adverse effects include: Increased levels of anxiety, altered exploratory behaviour, reduced social interaction or increased aggression and deficits in spatial or recognition learning and memory.

They are found in plastics and plasticizers (bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates), in industrial chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and include some pesticides and fungicides such as vinclozolin. These chemicals act on hormone receptors and their downstream signaling pathways, and can interfere with hormone synthesis, metabolism, and actions. Because the developing brain is particularly sensitive to endogenous hormones, disruptions by EDCs can change neural circuits that form during periods of brain organization. Here, we review the evidence that EDCs affect developing hypothalamic neuroendocrine systems, and change behavioral outcomes in juvenile, adolescent, and adult life in exposed individuals, and even in their descendants. Our focus is on social, communicative and sociosexual behaviors, as how an individual behaves with a same- or opposite-sex conspecific determines that individual's ability to exist in a community, be selected as a mate, and reproduce successfully.},

This study aimed to investigate the associations between maternal hormone levels during early pregnancy (≤15th week of pregnancy) and reproductive markers in infant boys (n = 37; 61.67 \%; average age 3.51 ± 0.73 months) and girls (n = 23; 38.33 \%; average age 3.30 ± 0.33 months) concerning prenatal exposure to phthalates. We used high-performance liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), and electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay to quantify urinary concentrations of phthalates and serum concentrations of hormones, respectively. In Mother-Infant Study Cohort (PRENATAL), we observed positive and negative correlations between infants' reproductive markers and phthalate metabolites (p ≤ 0.05). Next, we noticed associations between the penile length and maternal testosterone (β = 0.464) and estradiol levels (β = −0.365) with increasing significance after adjustment to maternal mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) and monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) (p ≤ 0.05). We observed a positive association (β = 0.337) between penile width and maternal testosterone with increasing significance after adjustment to maternal mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP) (p ≤ 0.05). In a group of girls, we reported a negative association between ACD/AFD ratio and maternal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels with increasing significance after adjustment to maternal monoethyl phthalate (MEP), MnBP, and mono(hydroxy-iso-butyl) phthalate (OH-MiBP). Our results highlight that prenatal phthalate exposure may modulate the effects of maternal hormone levels during early pregnancy on infants' reproductive markers.},

	abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is among the best-studied endocrine disrupting chemicals, known to act via multiple steroid hormone receptors to mediate a myriad of cellular effects. Pre-, peri-, and postnatal BPA exposure have been linked to a variety of altered behaviors in multiple model organisms, ranging from zebrafish to frogs to mammalian models. Given that BPA can cross the human placental barrier and has been found in the serum of human fetuses during gestation, BPA has been postulated to adversely affect ongoing neurodevelopment, ultimately leading to behavioral disorders later in life. Indeed, the brain has been identified as a key developmental target for BPA disruption. Despite these known associations between gestational BPA exposure and adverse developmental outcomes, as well as an extensive body of evidence existing in the literature, the mechanisms by which BPA induces its cellular- and tissue-specific effects on neurodevelopmental processes still remains poorly understood at a mechanistic level. In this review we will briefly summarize the effects of gestational BPA exposure on neural developmental mechanisms and resulting behaviors, and then present suggestions for how we might address gaps in our knowledge to develop a fuller understanding of endocrine neurodevelopmental disruption to better inform governmental policy against the use of BPA or other endocrine disruptors.},

	abstract = {Concerns about the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) on human brain and behavior are not novel; however, Grohs and colleagues have contributed groundbreaking data on this topic in a recent issue of Environmental Health. For the first time, associations were reported between prenatal BPA exposure and differences in children’s brain microstructure, which appeared to mediate the association between this exposure and children’s behavioral symptoms. Findings in numerous previous mother-child cohorts have pointed in a similar worrying direction, linking higher BPA exposure during pregnancy to more behavioral problems throughout childhood as assessed by neuropsychological questionnaires. Notwithstanding, this body of work has not been adequately considered in risk assessment. From a toxicological perspective, results are now available from the CLARITY-BPA consortium, designed to reconcile academic and regulatory toxicology findings. In fact, the brain has consistently emerged as one of the most sensitive organs disrupted by BPA, even at doses below those considered safe by regulatory agencies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In this Commentary, we contextualize the results of Grohs et al. within the setting of previous epidemiologic and CLARITY-BPA data and express our disquiet about the “all-or-nothing” criterion adopted to select human data in a recent EFSA report on the appraisal methodology for their upcoming BPA risk assessment. We discuss the most relevant human studies, identify emerging patterns, and highlight the need for adequate assessment and interpretation of the increasing epidemiologic literature in this field in order to support decision-making. With the aim of avoiding a myopic or biased selection of a few studies in traditional risk assessment procedures, we propose a future reevaluation of BPA focused on neurotoxicity and based on a systematic and comprehensive integration of available mechanistic, animal, and human data. Taken together, the experimental and epidemiologic evidence converge in the same direction: BPA is a probable developmental neurotoxicant at low doses. Accordingly, the precautionary principle should be followed, progressively implementing stringent preventive policies worldwide, including the banning of BPA in food contact materials and thermal receipts, with a focus on the utilization of safer substitutes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many phthalates are environmental pollutants and toxic to humans. Following phthalate regulations, human exposure to phthalates has globally decreased with time in European countries, the US and Korea. Conversely, exposure to their substitutes DEHT and/or DINCH has increased. In other countries, including China, little is known on the time-trends in human exposure to these plasticizers.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate time-trends in the urinary concentrations of phthalates, DEHT, and DINCH metabolites, in general population from non-European countries, in the last decade.
METHODS: We compiled human biomonitoring (HBM) data from 123 studies worldwide in a database termed "PhthaLit". We analyzed time-trends in the urinary concentrations of the excreted metabolites of various phthalates as well as DEHT and DINCH per metabolite, age group, and country/region, in 2009-2019. Additionally, we compared urinary metabolites levels between continents.
RESULTS: We found solid time-trends in adults and/or children from the US, Canada, China and Taiwan. DEHP metabolites decreased in the US and Canada. Conversely in Asia, 5oxo- and 5OH-MEHP (DEHP metabolites) increased in Chinese children. For low-weight phthalates, the trends showed a mixed picture between metabolites and countries. Notably, MnBP (a DnBP metabolite) increased in China. The phthalate substitutes DEHT and DINCH markedly increased in the US.
SIGNIFICANCE: We addressed the major question of time-trends in human exposure to phthalates and their substitutes and compared the results in different countries worldwide.
IMPACT: Phthalates account for more than 50\% of the plasticizer world market. Because of their toxicity, some phthalates have been regulated. In turn, the consumption of non-phthalate substitutes, such as DEHT and DINCH, is growing. Currently, phthalates and their substitutes show high detection percentages in human urine. Concerning time-trends, several studies, mainly in Europe, show a global decrease in phthalate exposure, and an increase in the exposure to phthalate substitutes in the last decade. In this study, we address the important question of time-trends in human exposure to phthalates and their substitutes and compare the results in different countries worldwide.},

Several phthalates have been recognized as substances of very high concern (SVHCs) in the EU, because of their toxicity for reproduction. However, high amounts of other phthalates are still produced and imported in the European Economic Area. In China and the US, recent studies show increasing concentrations of several phthalates in the air and in human urine, respectively. The understanding of phthalate absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination ('pharmacokinetics') in the organism is still limited. Specifically, phthalate partitioning among tissues is insufficiently understood. Here, we estimate partition coefficient (PC) values for different phthalates by using five algorithms and compare them to experimental (in-vivo and in-vitro) PC values. In addition, we review all pharmacokinetic steps for phthalates in human and rat, based on data from 133 peer-reviewed publications. We analyze the factors that determine phthalate partitioning and pharmacokinetics. Four processes are particularly relevant to phthalate distribution: protein binding, ionization, passive partitioning, and metabolism in different tissues. The interplay of these processes needs to be better represented in methods for determining the PC values of phthalates. The hydrophobicity of phthalates affects all pharmacokinetic steps. The exposure route has an influence on specific steps of phthalate pharmacokinetics but generally does not affect the pattern of metabolites in urine. The age of the organism has an influence on phthalate metabolism. More studies on the protein-bound fraction of phthalates in plasma and pharmacokinetic studies following inhalation and dermal exposure are desirable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human exposures to bisphenol A (BPA) are widespread. The current study addresses uncertainties regarding human pharmacokinetics of BPA.
OBJECTIVE: To reduce uncertainties about the metabolism and excretion of BPA in humans following oral administration.
METHODS: We exposed six men and eight women to 100 μg/kg bw of deuterated BPA (d6-BPA) by oral administration and conducted blood and urine analysis over a three day period. The use of d6-BPA allowed administered d6-BPA to be distinguished from background native (unlabeled) BPA. We calculated the rate of oral absorption, serum elimination, half-life, area under the curve (AUC), urinary excretion, and metabolism to glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.
RESULTS: Mean serum total (unconjugated and conjugated) d6-BPA Cmax of 1711 nM (390 ng/ml) was observed at Tmax of 1.1 ± 0.50h. Unconjugated d6-BPA appeared in serum within 5-20 min of dosing with a mean Cmax of 6.5 nM (1.5 ng/ml) observed at Tmax of 1.3 ± 0.52 h. Detectable blood levels of unconjugated or total d6-BPA were observed at 48 h in some subjects at concentrations near the LOD (0.001-0.002 ng/ml). The half-times for terminal elimination of total d6-BPA and unconjugated d6-BPA were 6.4 ± 2.0 h and 6.2 ± 2.6h, respectively. Recovery of total administered d6-BPA in urine was 84-109\%. Most subjects (10 of 14) excreted {\textgreater}90\% as metabolites within 24h.
CONCLUSIONS: Using more sensitive methods, our study expands the findings of other human oral pharmacokinetic studies. Conjugation reactions are rapid and nearly complete with unconjugated BPA comprising less than 1\% of the total d6-BPA in blood at all times. Elimination of conjugates into urine largely occurs within 24h.},

	abstract = {We discuss considerations that are essential when evaluating exposure to nonpersistent, semivolatile environmental chemicals such as phthalates and phenols (e.g., bisphenol A). A biomarker should be chosen to best represent usual personal exposures and not recent, adventitious, or extraneous exposures. Biomarkers should be selected to minimize contamination arising from collection, sampling, or analysis procedures. Pharmacokinetics should be considered; for example, nonpersistent, semivolatile chemicals are metabolized quickly, and urine is the compartment with the highest concentrations of metabolites. Because these chemicals are nonpersistent, knowledge of intraindividual reliability over the biologic window of interest is also required. In recent years researchers have increasingly used blood as a matrix for characterizing exposure to nonpersistent chemicals. However, the biologic and technical factors noted above strongly support urine as the optimal matrix for measuring nonpersistent, semivolatile, hydrophilic environmental agents.},

	abstract = {Background: The Navigation Guide methodology was developed to meet the need for a robust method of systematic and transparent research synthesis in environmental health science. We conducted a case study systematic review to support proof of concept of the method.
Objective: We applied the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology to determine whether developmental exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) affects fetal growth in humans.
Methods: We applied the first 3 steps of the Navigation Guide methodology to human epidemiological data: 1) specify the study question, 2) select the evidence, and 3) rate the quality and strength of the evidence. We developed a protocol, conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, and identified relevant studies using prespecified criteria. We evaluated each study for risk of bias and conducted meta-analyses on a subset of studies. We rated quality and strength of the entire body of human evidence.
Results: We identified 18 human studies that met our inclusion criteria, and 9 of these were combined through meta-analysis. Through meta-analysis, we estimated that a 1-ng/mL increase in serum or plasma PFOA was associated with a –18.9 g (95\% CI: –29.8, –7.9) difference in birth weight. We concluded that the risk of bias across studies was low, and we assigned a “moderate” quality rating to the overall body of human evidence.
Conclusion: On the basis of this first application of the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology, we concluded that there is “sufficient” human evidence that developmental exposure to PFOA reduces fetal growth.

	abstract = {Background: Synthesizing what is known about the environmental drivers of health is instrumental to taking prevention-oriented action. Methods of research synthesis commonly used in environmental health lag behind systematic review methods developed in the clinical sciences over the past 20 years.
Objectives: We sought to develop a proof of concept of the “Navigation Guide,” a systematic and transparent method of research synthesis in environmental health.
Discussion: The Navigation Guide methodology builds on best practices in research synthesis in evidence-based medicine and environmental health. Key points of departure from current methods of expert-based narrative review prevalent in environmental health include a prespecified protocol, standardized and transparent documentation including expert judgment, a comprehensive search strategy, assessment of “risk of bias,” and separation of the science from values and preferences. Key points of departure from evidence-based medicine include assigning a “moderate” quality rating to human observational studies and combining diverse evidence streams.
Conclusions: The Navigation Guide methodology is a systematic and rigorous approach to research synthesis that has been developed to reduce bias and maximize transparency in the evaluation of environmental health information. Although novel aspects of the method will require further development and validation, our findings demonstrated that improved methods of research synthesis under development at the National Toxicology Program and under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are fully achievable. The institutionalization of robust methods of systematic and transparent review would provide a concrete mechanism for linking science to timely action to prevent harm.

	doi = {10.1016/j.envint.2016.03.009},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are reports of developmental and reproductive health effects associated with the widely used biocide triclosan.
OBJECTIVE: Apply the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology to answer the question: Does exposure to triclosan have adverse effects on human development or reproduction?
METHODS: We applied the first 3 steps of the Navigation Guide methodology: 1) Specify a study question, 2) Select the evidence, and 3) Rate quality and strength of the evidence. We developed a protocol, conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, and identified relevant studies using pre-specified criteria. We assessed the number and type of all relevant studies. We evaluated each included study for risk of bias and rated the quality and strength of the evidence for the selected outcomes. We conducted a meta-analysis on a subset of suitable data.
RESULTS: We found 4282 potentially relevant records, and 81 records met our inclusion criteria. Of the more than 100 endpoints identified by our search, we focused our evaluation on hormone concentration outcomes, which had the largest human and non-human mammalian data set. Three human studies and 8 studies conducted in rats reported thyroxine levels as outcomes. The rat data were amenable to meta-analysis. Because only one of the human thyroxine studies quantified exposure, we did not conduct a meta-analysis of the human data. Through meta-analysis of the data for rats, we estimated for prenatal exposure a 0.09\% (95\% CI: -0.20, 0.02) reduction in thyroxine concentration per mg triclosan/kg-bw in fetal and young rats compared to control. For postnatal exposure we estimated a 0.31\% (95\% CI: -0.38, -0.23) reduction in thyroxine per mg triclosan/kg-bw, also compared to control. Overall, we found low to moderate risk of bias across the human studies and moderate to high risk of bias across the non-human studies, and assigned a "moderate/low" quality rating to the body of evidence for human thyroid hormone alterations and a "moderate" quality rating to the body of evidence for non-human thyroid hormone alterations.
CONCLUSION: Based on this application of the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology, we concluded that there was "sufficient" non-human evidence and "inadequate" human evidence of an association between triclosan exposure and thyroxine concentrations, and consequently, triclosan is "possibly toxic" to reproductive and developmental health. Thyroid hormone disruption is an upstream indicator of developmental toxicity. Additional endpoints may be identified as being of equal or greater concern as other data are developed or evaluated.},
